Considering my background as a protein engineer, I’m excited to be applying for the
Scientist position at Rejuvenate Bio. 
For the past 14 years I have developed diverse skillset that remarkably intersects with the qualifications you seek. Given the opportunity, 
I'm eager to apply my talents at the ground floor of research at Rejuventae Bio.

\vspace{0.1in}
While working on my doctoral thesis in the field of antibody design, my research project involved one of the first applications of next-generation 
sequencing to characterizing B cell repertoires.
I also joined the Rosetta Commons as a developer and pioneered antibody redesign algorithms which incorporated NGS datasets. I was also in a unique dual 
mentor program spending half my time in the wet-lab carrying out the experimentation necessary to validate my computational work. This gave me an advantage 
of learning both the computational and experimental sides of protein engineering.

\vspace{0.1in}
My post doctoral work in the laboratory of William Schief expanded my skillset by adding display technology and library design. I used Rosetta to inform 
mammalian and yeast 
display and was able to engineer the first vaccine able to selectively target rare B cells. For the past seven months I have transitioned to industry as a 
Senior Scientist in Protein Engineering. In my short time, I have developed new algorithms to design novel peptides to shape phage display libraries.

\vspace{0.1in}
I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Scientist position at Rejuvenate Bio. I'm very committed individual and have a tremendous amount
 to offer a company in Rejuvenate's position.
Feel free to contact my by email or phone attached at the bottom of this letter. I will also be in San Diego from April 17-25th.
