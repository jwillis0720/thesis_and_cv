Considering my background as a computational biologist in the fields of bioinformatics, deep learning and protein engineering, I'm excited to be applying for the
Senior Bioinformatics Engineer position at Helix. 
For the past 14 years I have developed diverse skillset that remarkably intersects with the qualifications you seek. In reviewing skills that are important for this position, I have a mastery or proficiency in all the required skills (software engineering, communication and AWS proficiency), 
and  a mastery of nearly all the skills considered a plus, including a PhD in Computational Biology, mastery of analyzing human NGS, mastery of manipulating large datasets, and lots of experience with DevOps. 

While working on my doctoral thesis in computational biology, my research project involved one of the first applications of next-generation 
sequencing to characterizing B cell repertoires. 
I also joined the Rosetta Commons as a developer and pioneered antibody design algorithms which incorporated next-generation sequencing datasets. My research influenced the nexus of applied molecular modeling for antibodies as it's now a common part of most antibody development pipelines. I was also in a unique dual 
mentor program spending half my time in the wet-lab carrying out the experimentation necessary to validate my computational work. This gave me an advantage 
of learning both the computational and experimental sides of protein engineering and bioinformatics.

\vspace{0.1in}
My post doctoral work at the Scripps Research Institute expanded my skillset by adding display technology and library design. I used Rosetta to inform 
mammalian and yeast 
display and was able to engineer the first vaccine able to selectively induce rare antibodies with long HCDR3 sequences.  In addition I developed, curated, and analyzed the largest antibody 
repertoire datasets to date with over 1 billion unique, searchable sequences.

For the past year, I have transitioned to industry as a 
Senior and Principal Scientist in Computational and Protein Engineering. I have developed new algorithms to design novel peptides to shape phage display libraries to pulldown rare therapeutic antibodies.
I also started integrating molecular modeling, protein dynamics and deep learning algorithms to design new functional protein topologies. Recently, I was recruited for a Principal Scientist of protein engineering to develop immunologically silent AAV capsids. 


\vspace{0.1in}
I'm looking forward to learning more details about the Senior Bioinformatics Engineer position at Helix. I'm very committed individual and have a tremendous amount
 to offer a company like Helix. I'm extremely hard working and motivated. I'm always eager to learn the latest technology to solve any given scientific problem. 
Feel free to contact me by email or phone attached at the bottom of this letter.
