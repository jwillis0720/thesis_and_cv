\section{Antibody Overview}
The lymphocytes that make up the adaptive immune system have evolved to recognize a limitless number of antigens that constitute viruses, bacteria and all foreign material to a hosts immune system  \citep{Murphy:2007tl}. The concern of this thesis is on the antigen-recognition molecules of the B-cell known as immunoglobulins (Ig). These can exist either as a membrane-anchored form on the B-cell known as the B-cell receptor (BCR) or as a secreted form with a wide range of functionality known as antibodies. The main effector function of antibodies is to bind foreign pathogens in the body, and this is the basis for the adaptive immune response. Antibodies have two separate functions. One is to bind specifically to molecules known as antigens. The other is to recruit other cells and molecules to destroy the pathogens to which immunoglobulins are bound. There are two genetic domains that make up the antibody structure and differentiate these processes (figure \ref{fig:antibodyoverview}). One is the variable domain responsible for specificity. The other is the constant domain that engages different effector functions such as complement recruitment and phagocytosis of compromised cells. Structurally, antibodies consist of two identical heavy chains, that are encoded by recombined gene segments of the heavy variable and constant domain gene segments, and two identical light chains, that are encoded by recombined copies of light chain variable and constant domains gene segments.

The variability of antibodies is what ensures that any individual with a functional immune system can produce antibodies to recognize almost any structure. The mechanisms of variability are discussed in further sections but are typically distributed to the tips of the antibody. It is important to note that B-cell bound receptors and effector functions of antibodies play important roles in the humoral immune system, but the remainder of this document will focus on the diversity and specificity of secreted antibodies of the IgG class, the most common circulating immunoglobulin.

\subsection{Antibody Diversification}
The antibody genes that encode heavy and light chains are located in three primary locations in the human genome: heavy chain genes (IGH) are located on chromosome 14, light chain kappa genes (IGK) are located on chromosome 2, and light chain lambda genes (IGK) are located on chromosome 22 \citep{Brochet:2008kq}. Each of these loci consists of multiple variable (V, not to be confused with the variable region of an antibody) and joining (J) gene segments. In addition, the IGH locus also contains several diversity (D) gene segments.  Sequencing of the human IGH locus revealed 55 functional V genes, 23 D genes, and six J genes \citep{Matsuda:1998ua,Lefranc:2009ga}.

The human variable genes (and, at the IGH locus, the diversity genes) can be grouped phylogenetically into families based on sequence similarity. Heavy chain variable genes are organized into seven families and homology within gene families is typically above 80\%. The 23 functional human diversity genes are also organized into seven families. For an example variable gene, IGVH5-15*01, the standard IMGT nomenclature for human V and D genes follows the following pattern: the chain and gene description (IGHV for variable genes, IGHD for germline genes), the family (5 in this example), the gene number (determined by position in the germline locus, 15 in this example), and the allele. The gene number is separated from the family with a hyphen and the allele is separated from the gene number with an asterisk.


\subsubsection{Recombination to Enable Diversity}
The tremendous sequence and structural diversity of antibodies can be attributed to two immunologic processes that act on antibody germline gene segments. The first is the initial recombination initiated by the recombination activating gene machinery (RAG) \citep{Brack:1978ie,Alt:1982uq,Tonegawa:1983vw,Schatz:1989tk,Oettinger:1990ud}. The RAG machinery is responsible for the recombination of V, D, and J gene for the heavy chain, and the V and J gene for the light chain (figure \ref{fig:Diversification}, left-panel). This process takes place to make functional B-cell receptors in the bone marrow, before antigenic stimuli. If a B-cell receptor is found to bind self-antigens of the host, it is eliminated. This clonal selection and deletion is the fundamental process for which antibodies are able to recognize foreign antigens while not attacking the host.

Recombination signal sequences (RSS), which flank V, D and J genes and are composed of conserved AT-rich heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by spacers of either 12 or 23 nucleotides, are recognized and bound by recombination activating gene (RAG1 and RAG2) encoded proteins at the initiation of the recombination process \citep{Hesse:1989us,Alt:1992bh}. Recombination typically occurs only between RSS elements of different spacer lengths, in a model commonly referred to as the 12/23 rule of recombination \citep{Ramsden:1996tw,Steen:1996ut,vanGent:1996uw,Schatz:2011hb}. After binding to one 12-bp RSS and one 23-bp RSS, the RAG complex induces single-strand DNA nicks between the coding sequence and the heptamer of each RSS, resulting in hairpin formation on each of the coding ends and a blunt double-stranded break on each signal end \citep{Roth:1992wg,Schlissel:1993tg,McBlane:1995kp,Sadofsky:2001we}. The hairpins are opened with another components of the RAG mutation machinery known as Artemis \citep{Ma:2002en}. Nucleotides may be added or removed from the coding ends, and the double strand breaks at the coding ends are joined into a single coding strand with DNA ligase IV \citep{Lewis:1994vp,Mahajan:1999wz,Shockett:1999vp,Walker:2001kn,MansillaSoto:2003ws,Roth:2003ji} (figure \ref{fig:Diversification}, middle panel). The newly recombined gene produces an antibody (figure \ref{fig:Diversification}, right panel). Recombination of the light chain is similar but the result of a single V$_{L}$J$_{L}$ recombination. To establish a diverse \naive~antibody repertoire, that is, antibodies that have not encountered antigens, these events of RAG-mediated recombination produce an initial repertoire of ~$3~x~10^{11}$ different recombinations. This process happens before antigen stimulus in the bone marrow leading to the next form of antibody diversity, somatic hypermutation.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Somatic Hypermutation to Enable Diversity}
Maturation of the antibody repertoire to hone specificity is known as somatic hypermutation (SHM) and is initiated by the somatic hypermutation machinery (SHMM). Somatic hypermutation is the response to antigen stimulus and occurs in various lymph tissues to diversify the antibody repertoire \citep{Tonegawa:1983vw,Brenner:1966vj}.

Na\"{i}ve, antigen-inexperienced, B-cells undergo the SHM process upon recognition of an infectious agent. It is through the SHM process, which occurs primarily in lymphoid tissue, mutate the variable region of their antibody genes (figure \ref{fig:somaticdiversification})  \citep{Li:2004it,MacLennan:1992we}. Many of these mutations have no effect on antigen recognition and many have deleterious effects on either antigen recognition or proper folding of the antibody protein. However, some mutations produce antibodies with improved affinity for the target pathogenic epitope  \citep{Casali:2006dn}. Thus, the SHM process provides a basis for the positive selection of high affinity antibodies that are characteristic of a mature immune response  \citep{MacLennan:1994bo}. SHM introduces point mutations at a frequency of approximately $1$ in $10^{3}$ per base pair, which is 10\textsuperscript{6}-fold higher than the rate of spontaneous mutation in other genes \citep{Rajewsky:1987wn}. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for SHM and initiates the SHM process by the deamination of cytosine nucleotides, which results in the conversion of cytosine to uracil \citep{Muramatsu:2000um,Muramatsu:1999ur}. Deamination thus produces a uracil-guanine mismatch, and several processes result in the error-prone repair of the mismatch. The precise mechanism(s) responsible for error-prone repair during SHM are not known, although several DNA repair mechanisms have been shown to be critical to the SHM process, including base excision repair and mismatch repair \citep{Phung:1998vx,Rada:1998tf,Wiesendanger:2000wl,DiNoia:2002ix,Zheng:2005dy}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Implications for Antibody Structure}
Antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs, also referred to as hypervariable regions, figure \ref{fig:abwithloops}) are the primary region of antigen recognition that lie in loop regions of the antibody framework (figure \ref{fig:abwithloops}). They are preferentially targeted for affinity maturation by the SHM machinery, making them the most variable regions of the antibody gene \citep{Padlan:1994wq}.  Structurally, the CDRs are largely loop-based, which makes them sufficiently flexible to incorporate the substitutions without compromising structural integrity. Framework regions (FRs) are highly structured and less able to accommodate somatic mutations \citep{Jimenez:2003by}.

\section{HIV Pandemic Overview}
HIV-1 is an unprecedented health problem that continues to remain a worldwide pandemic. Since the recognition of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981 \citep{Gottlieb:1981ge} followed by the discovery of its causative agent, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 1983 \citep{BarreSinoussi:1983ta}, an estimated 65 million have been infected with over 25 million deaths \citep{Hemelaar:2012cv}. The amount of people estimated to living with HIV is 30 million, many of whom live in the developing world \citep{Anonymous:1vVbBZBX}.

More than 40 different non-human primate species harbor SIV infections, with each species carrying a species-specific virus. Each independent zoonotic transmission can generate a different lineage. HIV type 1 (HIV-1), thought to be transmitted from chimpanzees in the Congo around 1900 \citep{Keele:2006fi}, is the most common and further is split into groups M, N, O, and P. HIV-1 group M is responsible for the global pandemic and is further split into subtypes clades A-D,F-H, J and K that are tropic to specific regions. Within each subtype, variation of the amino acids vary as much as 30\%. For example, clade B is the most common in North America while clade C is the most common in Sub-Saharan Africa (figure \ref{fig:pandemic}). If full genome sequences are found that result from recombinations of different HIV-1 group M subtypes, they are designated circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). If they are epidemiologically linked or unique recombinant forms they are unlinked (URF) \citep{Robertson:2000bv}.

A major contributing factor to HIV spread and defense is its potential for enormous genetic diversity. This genetic diversity stems from the error rates of the reverse-transcription machinery which lacks proof-reading capabilities \citep{Ho:1995fn}. This genetic diversity, particularly in the envelope gene (Env), gives rise to sequence divergence of up to 10\% within a single individual \citep{Korber:2001tc}. This is one of the many defense mechanisms HIV uses to evade host response and contemporary vaccination strategies.

\subsection{The HIV Virus Genome and Structure}
HIV-1 is an enveloped virus containing a duplicate positive-strand RNA genome (figure \ref{fig:hivgenome}, left panel). The functional spike on the surface of the virion is the envelope (Env) glycoprotein and is coded by the \textit{Env} gene (figure \ref{fig:hivgenome}, right panel). The Env glycoprotein complex is originally produced as a single-chain glycoprotein precursor, gp160, which is cleaved by a cellular protease. Cleavage of gp160 results in the cell-surface attachment protein gp120 and the membrane-spanning protein gp41. The gp160 cleavage products are noncovalently linked and assembled into a trimer of gp120-gp41 heterodimers that are expressed on the virion surface \citep{Kowalski:1987vq}. Gp120 is heavily glycosylated, with nearly half the total mass being the result of N-linked glycans \citep{Poignard:2001hu}. It is composed of five variable regions (V1-V5) interspersed with five constant regions (C1-C5) \citep{Starcich:1986ty}. The principal function of the glycoprotein spike is to facilitate cell entry by binding to the primary cell-surface receptor, CD4, and one of the two common co-receptors, CCR5 or CXCR4. Binding to the receptor and co-receptor is accomplished by gp120, and fusion of the viral and cell membranes is mediated by gp41 \citep{Zwick:2001ei}.

The remaining genes for HIV-1 include viral enzymes such as the error-prone reverse transcriptase, the integrase that allows integration of viral DNA to the host genome, and protease, to allow cleavage of gene products into their functional subunits. There are also structural proteins that lie below the envelope that make up the inner matrix and nucleocapsid. There are also several accessory proteins, vpu, vif, vpr, p6, nef, rev, and tat which aid in combating host defense or enhancing viral fitness \citep{Fields:2007vu}. All of these proteins serve a significant purpose to the virulence and life cycle of the HIV-1 virus, but will not be discussed further as they have low antigenicity for the induction of antibodies, the primary focus of my research. However, a list of their genes and gene products can be found in figure \ref{fig:hivgenome}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{The Viral Spike and Humoral Resistance}
The failure of conventional experimental vaccine candidates to prime the immune system for a broad response against HIV-1 challenge is partially explained thorough the structural definition of the HIV-1 spike. Much of the surface is covered in carbohydrates that shield neutralizing epitopes \citep{Binley:2010du}. The conserved CD4 binding site is recessed and sits behind the hypervariable loops \citep{Burton:2005db}. The co-receptor binding site is also recessed unless CD4 has triggered a conformational shift exposing this region \citep{Harris:2011gm}. Another defense is the relative lability of the trimeric complex \citep{Wyatt:1998vs}. The gp120 head often sheds creating ``stumps'' that serve as decoy epitopes against the viral complex \citep{Liu:2008in}. In addition there are few functional trimeric spikes on the surface of HIV, limiting immune response to a few locations on the virion.

The biggest defense is sequence variability. Much of the antibody response is targeted to the hypervariable loops that can easily change sequence without much consequence to viral fitness. This is why the humoral response produces autologous or strain-specific neutralizing antibodies that must catch up to a constantly evolving antigenic target \citep{Albert:1990ua,Gray:2007hi,Pilgrim:1997wj,Richman:2003dc,Sagar:2006eb,Wei:2003ea}.

\section{Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies to HIV}
Given the major defenses of the HIV Env structure, there is a rather discouraging view for vaccine development. In fact, only four modestly neutralizing antibodies were discovered between 1991 and 2009 \citep{Burton:2005db,Kwong:2012cc}, two membrane proximal extracellular region (MPER) binding mAbs 2F5 and 4E10 \citep{Zwick:2001ei,Muster:1994tw}, a CD4 binding site neutralizing mAb b12 \citep{Burton:1994wl}, and a complex carbohydrate binding mAbs 2G12 \citep{Trkola:1996vb} (table \ref{tab:allmabs}, figure \ref{fig:bnabmap}).

It was thought that the conventional vaccine strategies could not stimulate the immune system to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV due to the extreme variability of the viruses and the capability of the virus to escape  antibody responses. Recently, technologies like high throughput neutralization assays were developed that could rapidly test sera for neutralization capacity \textit{in vitro}, allowing researchers to accurately quantify the neutralizing response of HIV infected patients \citep{Binley:2004hd,Blish:2007ef,Li:2005go,Mascola:2005fe,Montefiori:2005jt}. Several groups found that there were multiple patients who could neutralize very genetically diverse panels of HIV variants, even those variants that were not in that patients sub-type \citep{Binley:2008gj,DoriaRose:2010js,Simek:2009cn,Wu:2006cd}. That led to longitudinal studies to show how long it took for a broadly neutralizing response to develop. Researchers showed that this generally took anywhere from 2-4 years \citep{Gray:2011ki,Mikell:2011hr,Moore:2011hy}, with earliest time points arising at 1 year \citep{DoriaRose:2014ic}. The question still remained if those neutralizing responses were caused by few monoclonal antibody responses or just a large polyclonal response \citep{Gray:2007hi,Binley:2008gj,Li:2007em,Rong:2009ky,Sather:2009jb,Scheid:2009bv,Tomaras:2011bc,Walker:2010bm}.

The question was answered by the recent explosion of newly discovered broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated by multiple research groups \citep{Corti:2013ex}. It started with two new isolates, PG9 and PG16, from an African donor that led to the discovery of a completely new neutralizing epitope, which is the focus of my research (figure  \ref{fig:bnabmap}) \citep{Walker:2009cd}. Both PG9 and PG16 bind to a proteoglycan epitope through an extended HCDR3 structure \citep{McLellan:2011dg}.

The discovery of PG9 and PG16 led to newly characterized antibodies using similar techniques such as microneutralization screening, high-throughput sequencing, and hybridoma technology. The Haynes laboratory characterized additional long HCDR3 antibodies that bound similarly as PG9 and PG16 but with less breadth \citep{Bonsignori:2011dq}. There are other classes of glycan-dependent antibodies isolated by the Poignard group that bind the V3 and beta-strands that are higher potency than PG9 and PG16 \citep{Walker:2011ew}. Other MPER antibodies have also been characterized to by the Connors group such as 10e8 that neutralizes 98\% of viruses \citep{Huang:2012fh}. Focused epitopes designed computationally also can be used to identity some of the most potent antibodies to date (the VRC series) \citep{Wu:2010jv}. These antibodies were identified using a designed protein scaffold of gp120 that ``knocked-out'' non-neutralizing epitopes. Thus, only neutralizing antibodies would be isolated upon binding. I will not elaborate further on all of the antibodies characterized to date, their method of isolation and if any longitudinal studies were used to determine their pathways of development. These characteristics are summarized in table \ref{tab:allmabs} and figure \ref{fig:bnabmap}.

It is interesting to note, and important for the work that will be presented here, that the broadly neutralizing antibodies to date share one of two characteristics. They are either highly somatically mutated, indicative of years of chronic infection and selective pressure, or have a very long HCDR3 (figure \ref{fig:bnabcorrelation}). Both of these characteristics, long HCDRs or highly mutated genes, make it difficult to elicit such antibodies in a vaccine attempt, but will be discussed further in the upcoming chapters.

\section{\rosetta}
Many software packages exist for the specific tasks of threading, minimization, and design. The \rosetta~software suite includes algorithms for all of these tasks and was developed for computational modeling and analysis of protein structures; further, it is free for noncommercial users. It has enabled notable scientific advances in computational biology, including \textit{de novo} protein prediction, protein design, enzyme design, ligand docking and structure prediction of biological macromolecules and macromolecular complexes \citep{Rohl:2004bl,Siegel:2010bc,Kuhlman:2003kp,Davis:2009bf,Misura:2006hs,Davis:2009fx,Das:2008gf}. The broad spectrum of applications available through \rosetta~allows for multiple computational problems to be addressed in one software framework. To aid in the understanding of \rosetta-specific language, a supplementary glossary has been provided in Appendix \ref{sec:appI}.

One of the most common applications of \rosetta~is protein structure prediction via \textit{de novo} folding and comparative modeling \citep{Kaufmann:2010ea,Rohl:2004bl}. \textit{De novo} folding can be used to predict a protein's tertiary structure when only the primary sequence of a protein is known. However, to date, \rosetta~has been shown to successfully fold only small, soluble proteins (fewer than 150 amino acids), and it performs best if the proteins are mainly composed of secondary structural elements \citep{Meiler:2003dt}. Structures of helical membrane proteins between 51 and 145 residues were predicted to within 4\AA~of the native structure \citep{YarovYarovoy:2006br}, but only very small proteins (up to 80 residues) have been predicted to atomic-detail accuracy \citep{Bradley:2005bu,Bradley:2005fs,Das:2007em}. Accurate prediction of larger and/or more complex proteins can be achieved with the addition of experimental data, such as NMR chemical shifts and electron tomography maps \citep{Rohl:2005kx,Lange:2012hp,Lange:2012wo}.

Another application, protein threading, refers to the tolerance of a tertiary fold given PDB coordinates. The \rosetta~scoring function evaluates how well a sequence can ``'tolerate'' a structure. It is often referred to as the ``inverse folding problem''. The known template structure of which a sequence will be threaded reduces almost all-conformational space by providing a protein backbone scaffold. Threading has played a major role in aiding experimental design and the interpretation of experimental results. Results can be used to help predict structure-function relationships \citep{Kaufmann:2009cq}, and aid in designing proteins for binding pathogens \citep{Azoitei:2011jd,Correia:2010ck,Correia:2011bk,Correia:2011hr,Schief:2009ke}, determining thermostable proteins \citep{Stranges:2013em,Kuhlman:2002ka,Der:2011gt}, and aid in the determination of target residues for site-directed mutagenesis \citep{Keeble:2008hd,Fortenberry:2011gx}.

\subsection{The \rosetta~Energy Function}
All of the applications described above rely on a metric to score predictive models. This metric in \rosetta~is referred to as the \rosetta~energy function. The scoring function in \rosetta~is derived empirically through analysis of observed geometries of a subset of proteins in the PDB. We call this scoring function a knowledge-based scoring function, since it relies on previous knowledge of observed structures. The measurements include, but are not limited to, radius of gyration, packing density, distance/angle between hydrogen bonds and distance between two polar atoms. The measurements are converted into an energy function through Bayesian statistics \citep{Simons:1997do,Metropolis:1953vj}.

The scoring function in \rosetta~can be separated into two main categories: centroid-based scoring and all-atom scoring. The former is used for \textit{de novo} folding and initial rounds of loop building \citep{Rohl:2005kx,Simons:1997do,Simons:1999wp}. The side chains are represented as ``super-atoms'', or ``centroids'', which limit the degrees of freedom to be sampled while preserving some of the chemical and physical properties of the side chain. Although this centroid-based scoring function is important for \textit{de novo} folding, the folding protocol is not covered within the scope of this document.

The all-atom scoring function represents side chains in atomic detail. Similarly to the centroid-based scoring function, the all-atom scoring function comprises weighted individual terms that are summed to create a total energy for a protein. Most of the scoring terms are derived from knowledge-based potentials. The scoring function contains Newtonian physics based terms, including a 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential and a solvation potential. The 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential is split into two terms, an attractive term (fa\_atr) and a repulsive term (fa\_rep), for all van der Waals interactions \citep{Kuhlman:2000tc,Neria:1996wj}. The solvation potential (fa\_sol) models water implicitly and penalizes the burial of polar atoms \citep{Lazaridis:1999wi}. Interatomic electrostatic interactions are captured through a pair potential (fa\_pair) \citep{Simons:1999wp}, and an orientation-dependent hydrogen bond potential for long-range and short-range hydrogen bonding (hbond\_sc, hbond\_lr\_bb, hbond\_sr\_bb, and hbond\_bb\_sc, respectively) \citep{Gordon:1999tk,Wedemeyer:2003kh}. In addition to the electrostatic terms, the \rosetta~all-atom scoring function contains terms that dictate side chain conformations according to the Dunbrack rotamer library (fa\_dun) \citep{Dunbrack:1993jt,Dunbrack:1997kh}, preference for a specific amino acid given a pair of phi/psi angles (p\_aa\_pp), and preference for the phi/psi angles in a Ramachandran plot (rama) \citep{Rohl:2004bl,Wedemeyer:2003kh,RAMACHANDRAN:1963wj}.

\subsection{\rosetta~Energy Minimization}
\label{subsec:Rosetta Minimization}
When new sequences are threaded, or rebuilt onto target protein structures, it is often necessary to go through a round of energetic minimization. The protein undergoes all-atom refinement using the \rosetta~all-atom scoring function to yield an a protein model \citep{Bradley:2005bu}. Both threading and docking in \rosetta~involve an all-atom refinement of the protein. The protocol used for structural refinement, visually described in figure \ref{fig:minimization}, is often referred to as "relax". The goal of the relax protocol is to explore the local conformational space and to energetically minimize the protein. During this process, local interactions are improved by iterative side-chain repacking, in which new side chain conformations, or "rotamers", are selected from the Dunbrack library \citep{Dunbrack:1993jt}; and by gradient-based minimization of the entire model, in which the energy of the model is minimized as a function of the score. These small structural changes are evaluated according to the all-atom scoring function and are sampled in a Metropolis Monte Carlo method \citep{Metropolis:1953vj}. The ``relax'' protocol has been shown to markedly lower the overall energy of the \rosetta~model and is essential to achieving atomic detail accuracy \citep{Das:2008gf,Bradley:2005fs,Rohl:2005kx}.

\subsection{\rosetta~Design}
\label{sec:design}
Protein design seeks to determine an amino acid sequence that folds into a given protein structure or performs a given function. The \rosettadesign~algorithm is an iterative process that energetically optimizes both the structure and sequence of a protein \citep{Kuhlman:2003kp}. \rosettadesign~alternates between rounds of fixed backbone sequence optimization and flexible backbone energy minimization. During the sequence optimization step, a Monte Carlo simulated annealing search is used to sample the sequence space. Every amino acid is considered at each position in the sequence, and rotamers are picked from to the Dunbrack library \citep{Dunbrack:1993jt}. After each round of Monte Carlo sequence optimization, the backbone is relaxed to accommodate the designed amino acids. The practical uses of \rosettadesign~can be divided into five basic categories: design of novel folds. Redesign of existing proteins, design to enhance knowledge of structure, enzyme design, and design applied to translational medicine.

\subsubsection{Design of Novel Folds}
The \rosettadesign~method was implemented by Kuhlman and colleagues \citep{Kuhlman:2000tc}. The method has been used for the \textit{de novo} design of a fold that was not (yet) represented in the PDB \citep{Kuhlman:2003kp}. A starting backbone model consisting of a five-strand $\beta$-sheet and two packed helices was constructed with the \rosetta~\textit{de novo} protocol using distance constraints derived from a two-dimensional sketch. The sequence was designed iteratively with five simulation trials of 15 cycles each. The final sequence was expressed, and the structure was determined using X-ray crystallography. The experimental structure has an all-atom deviation to the predicted structure of <1.1\AA.

\subsubsection{Redesign of Existing Proteins}
When nine globular proteins were stripped of all side chains and then redesigned using \rosettadesign, the average sequence recovery was 35\% for all residues \citep{Dantas:2003vt}. In four of nine cases, the protein stability improved as measured by chemical denaturation. The structure of a redesigned human protein was determined experimentally. \rosettadesign~was then used to systematically identify mutations of carboxypeptidase that would improve the stability of the protein. All of the tested mutants were more stable than the wild-type protein, with the top-scoring mutant having a reduction of free energy of 5.2 kcal/mol.

\subsubsection{Design to Enhance Knowledge of Structure}
Protein design approaches have enhanced our knowledge of how protein sequence relates to protein structure. For instance, the finding that designed protein sequences are highly similar to the native sequence suggests that native protein sequences are optimal for their structure \citep{Kuhlman:2000tc}. Babor and Kortemme investigated the antibody sequence-structure relationship using \rosettadesign. They demonstrated that native sequences of antibody HCDR3 loops are optimal for conformational flexibility \citep{Babor:2009it}. The authors collected pairs of unbound and antigen-bound antibody structures. They used multiconstraint design to find low-scoring sequences that were consistent with both unbound and bound structures. The sequences predicted by multi-constraint design were more similar to the germline sequences than the sequences predicted to preferentially bind either the unbound or bound conformations.

\subsubsection{Enzyme Design}
The R\textsc{osetta}M\textsc{atch}~algorithm starts from the protein backbone and attempts to build toward the specified transition state geometry \citep{Zanghellini:2006is}. In this method, all possible active site positions are defined for the protein scaffold, and rotamers from the Dunbrack library are placed at each sequence position in the catalytic site. The sequence of the area surrounding the catalytic site is then designed.
Recently, the R\textsc{osetta}M\textsc{atch } algorithm was used to design enzymes that catalyze the retro-aldol reaction \citep{Jiang:2008jk}. The degrees of freedom in the transition state, the orientation of the active site side chains, and the conformations of the active site side chains were simultaneously optimized. Of 72 models tested, a total of 32 were found to have catalytic activity as much as four orders of magnitude greater than that of an uncatalyzed reaction. Two of the active enzymes were crystallized. The experimental structures shared a high degree of similarity with the computational design although the loop regions surrounding the catalytic site showed significant differences from the model.

Computationally designed functional Kemp elimination catalysts using R\textsc{osetta}M\textsc{atch } have also been designed. Quantum chemical predictions were used to generate an idealized transition state model, and R\textsc{osetta}M\textsc{atch}~was used to search for backbone configurations that would support the predicted transition state \citep{Rothlisberger:2008ef}.

\subsubsection{Design Applied to Translational Medicine}
The successes of the \rosettadesign~algorithm in predicting new sequences that optimize binding and answer questions about protein structure led to its application to more biomedical applications such as vaccine design and protein therapeutics. Fleishman \textit{et al.} used the paratope of an antibody to find hot-spot positions that neutralized influenza. Using these positions, they designed a protein that would properly present a mimic of the paratope. The crystal structure of the designed protein structure indicated that it did indeed present a functional paratope while functional studies confirmed its neutralization capacity \citep{Fleishman:2011fx}.

The works of the Schief group have expanded design to explore novel scaffolding approaches to be used as immunogens. Using \rosettadesign, they presented the epitope to broadly neutralizing antibodies 2F5 and 4E10 to HIV, which elicited this class of antibody in animal models \citep{Correia:2010ck,Ofek:2010bv}. In addition, the research group used \rosettadesign~to target potently neutralizing antibodies against the CD4 binding site while eliminating binding to non-neutralizing antibodies that bind to decoy epitopes \citep{Wu:2010jv}. More recently, this group has used design to mimic an epitope to respitory syncitial virus (RSV) that is now being tested in animal models \citep{Correia:2014jp}.

A current major challenge in protein design is the \textit{de novo} design of a novel protein-protein interface. So far, the most successful attempts at \textit{de novo} interface design have been relatively modest, focusing on small proteins and yielding micromolar affinity \citep{Mandell:2009he,Huang:2007ge}. This small boost in affinity often requires display technology to increase potency and specificity. The \rosetta~community is well aware of these limitations and work on increasing the accuracy of predicted interface mutations, particularly around hydrogen bonding networks and explicit solvent models \citep{Combs:2012tl}.

\section{The State of the Field}
Here I can describe the state of the field in molecular modeling and antibody design. I will describe molecular modeling as the ``folding-problem'', the solution of which, is considered to be the holy-grail of computational modeling. In a related field which is more applicable to my work, I describe the ``inverse-folding problem.''

\subsection{The Folding Problem}
As described, there have been tremendous advances in computational modeling and it's role as a promising surrogate for costly experimentation. However, most work in computational modeling serves as a proof-of-principle using known model systems as benchmarks. Most, if not all computational studies at the time of writing require an experimental validation of the model using the very experimentation for which they are trying to serve as a prediction. However, experimental structures are only currently available for less than 1/1000\textsuperscript{th} of the proteins for which sequences are known and that number is expected to increase with advances in high-throughput sequencing \citep{Moult:2014ff}. To that end, computer-aided structure prediction is expected to play a major role in helping solve the ever growing number of structures. But, where is the state of the field?

Computational structure prediction and computational docking have been continually evaluated in the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) and Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) community-wide experiments. These experiments have been invaluable to the field as they have served as a metric for evaluating the various international groups attempts to tackle the unsolved problems of protein folding and protein docking. This has served as a ``grand challenge'' in computational biology. A physics based approach coupled with a knowledge of protein folding pathways were expected to be the answer to this question, but as so far, knowledge-based approaches like those of \rosetta~have been the front runners in these assessments. However, physics based methods are starting to bear fruit, especially for refinement stages of molecular modeling, where the global fold is known, but full-atom placement is needed to optimize bond angles, distances and structure free energy.

For small proteins (<100 AA), \textit{ab initio} methods where a template is not used have been successful in predicting the overall topology of the structure. \rosetta~fairs particularly well in this task, as this application was what it was originally developed for \citep{Simons:1999wd}. For larger proteins, the view is quite bleak, as an improvement judged by CASP has only led to an increase of accurately predicted models by 24\% in two decades \citep{Kryshtafovych:2014bw}. This figure is not surprising as the search space increases exponentially as sequence space gets larger, and sampling methods like those of \rosetta~eventually hit a computational limit.

Homology modeling appears to be the more suitable method for structure prediction as it limits the search space to a certain folds. If the target and template sequence are sufficiently aligned, then many methods have shown to be accurate (as evaluated by CASP). The number of folds deposited is slowing down, which makes homology modeling a more viable solution to structure prediction.

Often, a handful of mutations are made to a known structure and it is the desired goal to model those mutations onto the existing structure and explain the effect at a molecular level. This is becoming easier to do as refinement stages of modeling progress. A few mutations often does not change the overall fold of protein molecules and their effects can be modeled accurately. This type of minimal mutational modeling is now a credible form of empirical science as it is appearing in more and more high-impact publications were a full crystal structure or solution NMR structure is not needed. I use this method here to explain observations to a traditional antibody known as PG9. This is detailed in chapter \ref{chap:chapter4}.

\subsection{The Inverse-Folding Problem}
The folding problem, which tries to accurately determine a protein structure given an amino acid sequence must consider many poorly understood principles of folding kinetics and thermodynamics. The problem is trying to find an accurate globular fold in which the free energy of the folded structure is considerably more stable than the entropy cost of the fold. However, this problem has created many all-atom "force fields" that are needed to evaluate such folds. The all-atom nature of these modeling trajectories created a new class of problems in the field that could be solved with these ``force fields.'' Rather than search for the lowest-energy structure for a given amino acid sequence, researchers are searching for the lowest-energy sequence for a given protein structure \citep{Baker:2014kn}. This is known as the ``inverse-folding problem'' and less formally known as protein design.

The problems that are relevant to the inverse-folding problem are related to the folding-problem. They often both use the same scoring function or ``force-field'', so a rapid and accurate knowledge- or physics-based approach has been the focus of many research groups. It is also a matter of exponential conformations that need to be sampled. In the protein-folding problem, what is the conformations that fit a given sequence. If each the length of the amino acid sequence, $A$, where each amino acid can sample $N$ conformations, then $A^N$ conformations are available to a complete sampling strategy. As cited in ``Levinthal's Paradox'', this is clearly not how proteins fold, and complete computational sampling of large proteins can't be completed with current technology \citep{Levinthal:1969wc}.

The sampling space needed for the inverse-protein is also similar. Instead of conformations, amino acid identities need to be sampled and scored. The same exponential sequence space formula is also applied, were a protein of length $A$, has $20^A$ sequence combinations to choose from the 20 canonical amino acids in mammalian system. The problem is compounded when several conformations or ``rotamers'' for each amino acid are considered, where $20^A$, no longer constant, but defined by the amount of ``rotamers'' considered $R$ as $R^N$. Regardless, protein-design has been far more successful at application driven research than the \textit{ab initio} methods. This is due to the reduced sequence space that needs to be sampled. For instance, we can define far fewer positions to be ``designed'' rather than the entire protein. We can also only consider certain amino acid identities (for instance, consider only hydrophobics in a core and hydrophilics in solvent-space). The success of protein-design is detailed in application driven research in section \ref{sec:design}.

\subsection{Antibody Design Summary}
The goal of this thesis exists in three main sections ranging from questions of basic science to application driven antibody design. However, it is not entirely clear how these concepts tie together. In figure \ref{fig:overview}, I show how antibody design can be used to scale up to vaccine applicability from answering basic immunologic questions. As the applicability progresses, one step informs the other. First, I will use antibody design to interrogate a very basic question about antibody specificity. That is, how does a finite set of antibody structures bind a near infinite antigen repertoire? Using principles derived from specificity, I can begin to redesign known antibodies to enhance specificity, and increase breadth. Finally, I can use antibody design and how it relates to specificity and breadth to interrogate the antibody structural repertoire. This answers questions about vaccine applicability. What does a normal structural repertoire look like? How close is it to forming a broadly neutralizing antibody that confers protection against HIV? If it is not close, how many mutations are necessary to achieving broad neutralization? All of these questions I aim to answer using antibody design with the \rosettadesign~application and the model system HIV.
