abstract = {Attempts to formulate a protective HIV-1 vaccine through classic vaccine design strategies have not been successful. Elicitation of HIV-1-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) at high titers that are present before exposure might be required to achieve protection. Recently, the application of new technologies has facilitated the study of clonal lineages of HIV-1 envelope (Env) antibodies, which have provided insights into HIV-1 antibody development during infection and upon vaccination. Strategies are being developed for the analysis of infection and vaccine candidate-induced antibodies, their gene usage, and their maturation pathways such that this information can be used to attempt to guide rational vaccine design.},

abstract = {Snakes are limbless predators, and many species use venom to help overpower relatively large, agile prey. Snake venoms are complex protein mixtures encoded by several multilocus gene families that function synergistically to cause incapacitation. To examine venom evolution, we sequenced and interrogated the genome of a venomous snake, the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), and compared it, together with our unique transcriptome, microRNA, and proteome datasets from this species, with data from other vertebrates. In contrast to the platypus, the only other venomous vertebrate with a sequenced genome, we find that snake toxin genes evolve through several distinct co-option mechanisms and exhibit surprisingly variable levels of gene duplication and directional selection that correlate with their functional importance in prey capture. The enigmatic accessory venom gland shows a very different pattern of toxin gene expression from the main venom gland and seems to have recruited toxin-like lectin genes repeatedly for new nontoxic functions. In addition, tissue-specific microRNA analyses suggested the co-option of core genetic regulatory components of the venom secretory system from a pancreatic origin. Although the king cobra is limbless, we recovered coding sequences for all Hox genes involved in amniote limb development, with the exception of Hoxd12. Our results provide a unique view of the origin and evolution of snake venom and reveal multiple genome-level adaptive responses to natural selection in this complex biological weapon system. More generally, they provide insight into mechanisms of protein evolution under strong selection.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW:To provide an update on the origin of the HIV epidemic and insights into how the immune response is shaping virus evolution.

RECENT FINDINGS:Characterization of archival samples showed that by the 1960s, HIV had already diverged within humans. It is now estimated that HIV has been in humans since at least the early 1900s. However, despite the potential for different divergent viruses to spread, surprisingly few viruses successfully expanded to cause the global epidemic. In approximately 80% of cases, productive infection is the result of infection with only a single virus or single virus-infected cell. After transmission, HIV evolves at a rapid rate driven by the immune pressure until the virus reaches a delicate survival balance: on one hand avoiding elimination through the development of cytotoxic T-cell immune escape mutations, and on the other sacrificing replication fitness as these mutations may come with a severe fitness cost to the virus. People infected with these 'attenuated' cytotoxic T-cell escape viruses can have a survival advantage. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are molding HIV diversity at a population level resulting in a loss of some of the common immune epitopes.

SUMMARY:Insights into the origin of HIV and its evolution between populations and within individuals is essential to understanding HIV pathogenesis and imperative for the design of effective biomedical interventions such as vaccines.},

abstract = {It is believed that immunoglobulin-variable region gene (IgV) somatic hypermutation (SHM) is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) upon deamination of cytidine to deoxyuracil. Patch-excision repair of these lesions involving error prone DNA polymerases such as poleta causes mutations at all base positions. If not repaired, the deaminated nucleotides on the coding and noncoding strands result in C-to-T and G-to-A exchanges, respectively. Herein it is reported that IgV gene evolution has been considerably influenced by the need to accommodate extensive C deaminations and the resulting accumulation of C-to-T and G-to-A exchanges. Although seemingly counterintuitive, the precise placement of C and G nucleotides causes most C-to-T and G-to-A mutations to be silent or conservative. We hypothesize that without intricate positioning of C and G nucleotides the efficiency of affinity maturation would be significantly reduced due to a dominance of replacements caused by C and G transition mutations. The complexity of these evolved biases in codon use are compounded by the precise concomitant hotspot/coldspot targeting of AID activity and Poleta errors to maximize SHM in the CDRs and minimize mutations in the FWRs.},

We isolated human monoclonal antibody 5J8, which neutralized a broad spectrum of 20th century H1N1 viruses and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Fine mapping of the interaction unexpectedly revealed a novel epitope between the receptor-binding pocket and the Ca₂ antigenic site on HA. This antibody exposes a new mechanism underlying broad immunity against H1N1 influenza viruses and identifies a conserved epitope that might be incorporated into engineered H1 virus vaccines.},

abstract = {The structural and functional significance of somatic insertions and deletions in antibody chains is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a naturally occurring three-amino-acid insertion within the influenza virus-specific human monoclonal antibody 2D1 heavy-chain variable region reconfigures the antibody-combining site and contributes to its high potency against the 1918 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses. The insertion arose through a series of events, including a somatic point mutation in a predicted hot-spot motif, introduction of a new hot-spot motif, a molecular duplication due to polymerase slippage, a deletion due to misalignment, and additional somatic point mutations. Atomic resolution structures of the wild-type antibody and a variant in which the insertion was removed revealed that the three-amino-acid insertion near the base of heavy-chain complementarity-determining region (CDR) H2 resulted in a bulge in that loop. This enlarged CDR H2 loop impinges on adjacent regions, causing distortion of the CDR H1 architecture and its displacement away from the antigen-combining site. Removal of the insertion restores the canonical structure of CDR H1 and CDR H2, but binding, neutralization activity, and in vivo activity were reduced markedly because of steric conflict of CDR H1 with the hemagglutinin antigen.},

abstract = {The burial of hydrophobic amino acids in the protein core is a driving force in protein folding. The extent to which an amino acid interacts with the solvent and the protein core is naturally proportional to the surface area exposed to these environments. However, an accurate calculation of the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), a geometric measure of this exposure, is numerically demanding as it is not pair-wise decomposable. Furthermore, it depends on a full-atom representation of the molecule. This manuscript introduces a series of four SASA approximations of increasing computational complexity and accuracy as well as knowledge-based environment free energy potentials based on these SASA approximations. Their ability to distinguish correctly from incorrectly folded protein models is assessed to balance speed and accuracy for protein structure prediction. We find the newly developed "Neighbor Vector" algorithm provides the most optimal balance of accurate yet rapid exposure measures.},

Passive immunization and challenge studies in non-human primates testify that broadly neutralizing antibodies (BrNAbs) can accomplish protection against infection. In recent years, the introduction of new techniques has facilitated the discovery of an unprecedented number of new human BrNAbs that target and delineate diverse conserved epitopes on the envelope glycoprotein spike (Env). The epitopes of these BrNAbs can serve as templates for immunogen design aimed to induce similar antibodies. Here we will review the characteristics of the different classes of BrNAbs and their target epitopes, as well as factors associated with their development and implications for vaccine design.},

abstract = {Structural flexibility in germline gene-encoded antibodies allows promiscuous binding to diverse antigens. The binding affinity and specificity for a particular epitope typically increase as antibody genes acquire somatic mutations in antigen-stimulated B cells. In this work, we investigated whether germline gene-encoded antibodies are optimal for polyspecificity by determining the basis for recognition of diverse antigens by antibodies encoded by three VH gene segments. Panels of somatically mutated antibodies encoded by a common VH gene, but each binding to a different antigen, were computationally redesigned to predict antibodies that could engage multiple antigens at once. The Rosetta multi-state design process predicted antibody sequences for the entire heavy chain variable region, including framework, CDR1, and CDR2 mutations. The predicted sequences matched the germline gene sequences to a remarkable degree, revealing by computational design the residues that are predicted to enable polyspecificity, i.e., binding of many unrelated antigens with a common sequence. The process thereby reverses antibody maturation in silico. In contrast, when designing antibodies to bind a single antigen, a sequence similar to that of the mature antibody sequence was returned, mimicking natural antibody maturation in silico. We demonstrated that the Rosetta computational design algorithm captures important aspects of antibody/antigen recognition. While the hypervariable region CDR3 often mediates much of the specificity of mature antibodies, we identified key positions in the VH gene encoding CDR1, CDR2, and the immunoglobulin framework that are critical contributors for polyspecificity in germline antibodies. Computational design of antibodies capable of binding multiple antigens may allow the rational design of antibodies that retain polyspecificity for diverse epitope binding.},

Here we analyzed the cross-neutralizing antibody responses in longitudinal plasmas collected soon after and up to seven years after HIV-1 infection. We find that anti-HIV-1 cross-neutralizing antibody responses first become evident on average at 2.5 years and, in rare cases, as early as 1 year following infection. If cross-neutralizing antibody responses do not develop during the first 2-3 years of infection, they most likely will not do so subsequently. Our results indicate a potential link between the development of cross-neutralizing antibody responses and specific activation markers on T cells, and with plasma viremia levels. The earliest cross-neutralizing antibody response targets a limited number of Env regions, primarily the CD4-binding site and epitopes that are not present on monomeric Env, but on the virion-associated trimeric Env form. In contrast, the neutralizing activities of plasmas from subjects that did not develop cross-neutralizing antibody responses target epitopes on monomeric gp120 other than the CD4-BS. Our study provides information that is not only relevant to better understanding the interaction of the human immune system with HIV but may guide the development of effective immunization protocols. Since antibodies to complex epitopes that are present on the virion-associated envelope spike appear to be key components of earliest cross-neutralizing activities of HIV-1+ plasmas, then emphasis should be made to elicit similar antibodies by vaccination.},

abstract = {Antibody heavy-chain recombination that results in the incorporation of multiple diversity (D) genes, although uncommon, contributes substantially to the diversity of the human antibody repertoire. Such recombination allows the generation of heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) regions of extreme length and enables junctional regions that, because of the nucleotide bias of N-addition regions, are difficult to produce through normal V(D)J recombination. Although this non-classical recombination process has been observed infrequently, comprehensive analysis of the frequency and genetic characteristics of such events in the human peripheral blood antibody repertoire has not been possible because of the rarity of such recombinants and the limitations of traditional sequencing technologies. Here, through the use of high-throughput sequencing of the normal human peripheral blood antibody repertoire, we analysed the frequency and genetic characteristics of V(DD)J recombinants. We found that these recombinations were present in approximately 1 in 800 circulating B cells, and that the frequency was severely reduced in memory cell subsets. We also found that V(DD)J recombination can occur across the spectrum of diversity genes, indicating that virtually all recombination signal sequences that flank diversity genes are amenable to V(DD)J recombination. Finally, we observed a repertoire bias in the diversity gene repertoire at the upstream (5') position, and discovered that this bias was primarily attributable to the order of diversity genes in the genomic locus.},

abstract = {Following the initial diversity generated by V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation is the principal mechanism for producing further antibody repertoire diversity in antigen-experienced B cells. While somatic hypermutation typically results in single-nucleotide substitutions, the infrequent incorporation of genetic insertions and deletions has also been associated with the somatic hypermutation process. We used high-throughput antibody sequencing to determine the sequence of thousands of antibody genes containing somatic hypermutation-associated insertions and deletions (SHA indels), which revealed significant differences between the location of SHA indels and somatic mutations. Further, we identified a cluster of insertions and deletions in the antibody framework 3 region, which corresponds to the hypervariable region 4 (HV4) in T-cell receptors. We propose that this HV4-like region, identified by SHA indel analysis, represents a region of under-appreciated affinity maturation potential. Finally, through the analysis of both location and length distribution of SHA indels, we have determined regions of structural plasticity within the antibody protein.},

This diversity is generated centrally through the assembly of variable, diversity and joining gene segments, and peripherally by somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination. The peripheral diversification process is thought to only occur in response to antigenic stimulus, producing antigen-selected memory B cells. Surprisingly, analyses of the variable, diversity and joining gene segments have revealed that the na{\"\i}ve and memory subsets are composed of similar proportions of these elements. Lacking, however, is a more detailed study, analyzing the repertoires of na{\"\i}ve and memory subsets at the level of the complete V(D)J recombinant.

abstract = {A number of antibodies that efficiently neutralize microbial targets contain long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) loops. For HIV, several of the most broad and potently neutralizing antibodies have exceptionally long HCDR3s. Two broad potently neutralizing HIV-specific antibodies, PG9 and PG16, exhibit secondary structure. Two other long HCDR3 antibodies, 2F5 and 4E10, protect against mucosal challenge with SHIV. Induction of such long HCDR3 antibodies may be critical to the design of an effective vaccine strategy for HIV and other pathogens, however it is unclear at present how to induce such antibodies. Here, we present genetic evidence that human peripheral blood antibodies containing long HCDR3s are not primarily generated by insertions introduced during the somatic hypermutation process. Instead, they are typically formed by processes occurring as part of the original recombination event. Thus, the response of B cells encoding antibodies with long HCDR3s results from selection of unusual clones from the na{\"\i}ve repertoire rather than through accumulation of insertions. These antibodies typically use a small subset of D and J gene segments that are particularly suited to encoding long HCDR3s, resulting in the incorporation of highly conserved genetic elements in the majority of antibody sequences encoding long HCDR3s.},

abstract = {To become infectious, HIV-1 particles undergo a maturation process involving proteolytic cleavage of the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. Immature particles contain a highly stable spherical Gag lattice and are impaired for fusion with target cells. The fusion impairment is relieved by truncation of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail (CT), indicating that an interaction between the immature viral core and gp41 within the particle represses HIV-1 fusion by an unknown mechanism. We hypothesized that the conformation of Env on the viral surface is regulated allosterically by interactions with the HIV-1 core during particle maturation. To test this, we quantified the binding of a panel of monoclonal antibodies to mature and immature HIV-1 particles by immunofluorescence imaging. Surprisingly, immature particles exhibited markedly enhanced binding of several gp41-specific antibodies, including two that recognize the membrane proximal external region (MPER) and neutralize diverse HIV-1 strains. Several of the differences in epitope exposure on mature and immature particles were abolished by truncation of the gp41 CT, thus linking the immature HIV-1 fusion defect with altered Env conformation. Our results suggest that perturbation of fusion-dependent Env conformational changes contributes to the impaired fusion of immature particles. Masking of neutralization-sensitive epitopes during particle maturation may contribute to HIV-1 immune evasion and has practical implications for vaccine strategies targeting the gp41 MPER.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are critical determinants in biological systems. Engineered proteins binding to specific areas on protein surfaces could lead to therapeutics or diagnostics for treating diseases in humans. But designing epitope-specific protein-protein interactions with computational atomistic interaction free energy remains a difficult challenge. Here we show that, with the antibody-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) interaction as a model system, the experimentally observed amino acid preferences in the antibody-antigen interface can be rationalized with 3-dimensional distributions of interacting atoms derived from the database of protein structures. Machine learning models established on the rationalization can be generalized to design amino acid preferences in antibody-antigen interfaces, for which the experimental validations are tractable with current high throughput synthetic antibody display technologies. Leave-one-out cross validation on the benchmark system yielded the accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity) and specificity of the overall binary predictions to be 0.69, 0.45, 0.63, and 0.71 respectively, and the overall Matthews correlation coefficient of the 20 amino acid types in the 24 interface CDR positions was 0.312. The structure-based computational antibody design methodology was further tested with other antibodies binding to VEGF. The results indicate that the methodology could provide alternatives to the current antibody technologies based on animal immune systems in engineering therapeutic and diagnostic antibodies against predetermined antigen epitopes.},

These records inform an understanding of the naive B cell repertoire, of somatic mutation, and of the resulting antibody features that are critical to effective HIV-1 neutralization; based on these, we propose an ontogeny and structure-based system of antibody classification.

Similarly, an effective vaccine against HIV-1 will likely need to induce antibodies that prevent initial infection of host cells or that limit early events of viral dissemination. Such antibodies must target the surface envelope glycoproteins of HIV-1, which are highly variable in sequence and structure. The first subunit vaccines to enter clinical trails were safe and immunogenic but unable to elicit antibodies that neutralized most circulating strains of HIV-1. However, potent virus neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) can develop during the course of HIV-1 infection, and this is the type of antibody response that researchers seek to generate with a vaccine. Thus, current vaccine design efforts have focused on a more detailed understanding of these broadly neutralizing antibodies and their epitopes to inform the design of improved vaccines.},

abstract = {The comparison of protein or nucleic acid sequences frequently leads to observations whose improbability can be tested only by Monte Carlo techniques that require randomizing the sequences being compared. Two decisions need to be made. One is whether one demands a resulting random sequence to have the properties of the original sequence (a shuffled sequence) or only expects it to have them (a representative sequence). The second decision concerns the properties of the sequence of which two are composition and nearest-neighbor frequencies. It is shown that biased nearest-neighbor frequencies can significantly affect the probability of observing a given result. Methods for producing random sequences according to these decisions are given.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is a common goal in biology, and is usually facilitated by having an accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described.},

Within the envelope, changes were most prevalent within the extracellular region where clustered nucleotide substitutions and deletions/insertions were evident. Based on predicted secondary protein structure and hydrophilicity, these hypervariable regions represent potential antigenic sites. In contrast to the hypervariable regions, other sequences in the extracellular envelope and the overall envelope structure (including 18 of 18 cysteine residues), as well as most of the transmembrane region, were highly conserved.},

During a full docking run in 21 of the 30 cases, RosettaLigand successfully found a native-like binding mode among the top ten scoring binding modes. From the benchmark cases we find that careful template selection based on ligand occupancy provides the best chance of success while overall sequence identity between template and target do not appear to improve results.

abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the "multiple segment Viterbi" (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call "sparse rescaling". These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.},

abstract = {Many theoretical advances have been made in applying probabilistic inference methods to improve the power of sequence homology searches, yet the BLAST suite of programs is still the workhorse for most of the field. The main reason for this is practical: BLAST's programs are about 100-fold faster than the fastest competing implementations of probabilistic inference methods. I describe recent work on the HMMER software suite for protein sequence analysis, which implements probabilistic inference using profile hidden Markov models. Our aim in HMMER3 is to achieve BLAST's speed while further improving the power of probabilistic inference based methods. HMMER3 implements a new probabilistic model of local sequence alignment and a new heuristic acceleration algorithm. Combined with efficient vector-parallel implementations on modern processors, these improvements synergize. HMMER3 uses more powerful log-odds likelihood scores (scores summed over alignment uncertainty, rather than scoring a single optimal alignment); it calculates accurate expectation values (E-values) for those scores without simulation using a generalization of Karlin/Altschul theory; it computes posterior distributions over the ensemble of possible alignments and returns posterior probabilities (confidences) in each aligned residue; and it does all this at an overall speed comparable to BLAST. The HMMER project aims to usher in a new generation of more powerful homology search tools based on probabilistic inference methods.},

This protocol provides a guide to interpreting the output of structure prediction servers in general and one such tool in particular, the protein homology/analogy recognition engine (Phyre). New profile-profile matching algorithms have improved structure prediction considerably in recent years. Although the performance of Phyre is typical of many structure prediction systems using such algorithms, all these systems can reliably detect up to twice as many remote homologies as standard sequence-profile searching. Phyre is widely used by the biological community, with >150 submissions per day, and provides a simple interface to results. Phyre takes 30 min to predict the structure of a 250-residue protein.},

abstract = {Point deletions in enzymes can vary in effect from negligible to complete loss of activity; however, these effects are not generally predictable. Deletions are widely observed in nature and often result in diseases such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, or osteogenesis imperfecta. Here, we have developed an algorithm to model the perturbed structures of deletion mutants with the ultimate goal of predicting their activities. The algorithm works by deleting the specified residue from the wild-type structure, creating a gap that is closed using a combination of local and global moves that change the backbone torsion angles of the protein structure. On a set of five proteins for which both wild-type and deletion mutant x-ray crystal structures are available, the algorithm produces deep, narrow energy funnels within 1.5 {\AA} of the crystal structure for the deletion mutants. To assess the ability of our algorithm to predict activity from the predicted structures, we tested the correlation of experimental activity with several measures of the predicted structure ensemble using a set of 45 point deletions from ricin. Estimates incorporating likely prevalence of active and inactive deletion sites suggest that activity can be predicted correctly over 60% of the time from the active site root-mean squared deviation of the lowest energy predicted structures. The predictions are stronger than simple sequence organization measures, but more fundamental work is required in structure prediction and enzyme activity determination to allow consistent prediction of activity.},

This assay has become the main endpoint neutralization assay used for the assessment of pre-clinical and clinical trial samples by a growing number of laboratories worldwide. Here we present the results of the formal optimization and validation of the TZM-bl assay, performed in compliance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP) guidelines. The assay was evaluated for specificity, accuracy, precision, limits of detection and quantitation, linearity, range and robustness. The validated manual TZM-bl assay was also adapted, optimized and qualified to an automated 384-well format.},

abstract = {We have determined the three-dimensional structure of two crystal forms of an antilysozyme Fab-lysozyme complex by x-ray crystallography. The epitope on lysozyme consists of three sequentially separated subsites, including one long, nearly continuous, site from Gln-41 through Tyr-53 and one from Gly-67 through Pro-70. Antibody residues interacting with lysozyme occur in each of the six complementarity-determining regions and also include one framework residue. Arg-45 and Arg-68 form a ridge on the surface of lysozyme, which binds in a groove on the antibody surface. Otherwise the surface of interaction between the two proteins is relatively flat, although it curls at the edges. The surface of interaction is approximately 26 X 19 A. No water molecules are found in the interface. The positive charge on the two arginines is complemented by the negative charge of Glu-35 and Glu-50 from the heavy chain of the antibody. The backbone structure of the antigen, lysozyme, is mostly unperturbed, although there are some changes in the epitope region, most notably Pro-70. One side chain not in the epitope, Trp-63, undergoes a rotation of approximately 180 degrees about the C beta--C gamma bond. The Fab elbow bends in the two crystal forms differ by 7 degrees.},

abstract = {There are now several crystal structures of antibody Fab fragments complexed to their protein antigens. These include Fab complexes with lysozyme, two Fab complexes with influenza virus neuraminidase, and three Fab complexes with their anti-idiotype Fabs. The pattern of binding that emerges is similar to that found with other protein-protein interactions, with good shape complementarity between the interacting surfaces and reasonable juxtapositions of polar residues so as to permit hydrogen-bond formation. Water molecules have been observed in cavities within the interface and on the periphery, where they often form bridging hydrogen bonds between antibody and antigen. For the most part the antigen is bound in the middle of the antibody combining site with most of the six complementarity-determining residues involved in binding. For the most studied antigen, lysozyme, the epitopes for four antibodies occupy approximately 45% of the accessible surface area. Some conformational changes have been observed to accompany binding in both the antibody and the antigen, although most of the information on conformational change in the latter comes from studies of complexes with small antigens.},

abstract = {We describe three sets of natural (preimmune) polyreactive antibodies and Ag-induced antibodies that share the same VH-VL combinations. The amino acid homology in the VH and VL segments averaged 92%. These sets were found among 49 neonatal and adult natural mAb that were compared with 35 Ag-induced monoclonals produced during the memory response to phosphocholine (PC)-keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Both groups of monoclonals had been selected on the basis of a restricted fine specificity pattern, namely the ability to recognize PC-protein and p-nitrophenyl phosphocholine but not PC. All of the antibodies were tested for reactivity against a panel of 15 self and foreign Ag. Despite their common fine specificity as the basis for selection, 33/49 natural antibodies were poly/auto reactive whereas 0/35 Ag-induced antibodies had such poly/auto reactive properties. The natural antibodies were encoded by genes representing nine different VH families and several V kappa and V lambda families. There were a few replacement substitutions distinguishing the Ag-induced antibodies from the natural antibodies in each set; however, the most noteworthy difference was the extreme variability of CDR3 in the natural antibodies that differed in both length and amino acid sequence from each other and from Ag-induced antibodies. The results suggest that CDR3 of the H chain may play a critical role in distinguishing poly- from monospecific combining sites in natural and Ag-induced antibodies.},

abstract = {Monoreactive high affinity pathologic autoantibodies were supposed previously to derive through somatic mutation from polyreactive low affinity autoantibodies that are encoded by a small set of unmutated V region genes in fetal and neonatal B cells. However, recent data exploring the physiologically expressed Ab repertoire and the importance of the stochastically generated heavy chain CDR3 (H-CDR3) in autoreactivity suggest that this scheme is incomplete. Here we analyzed via gene-swapping experiments and site-directed mutagenesis the relative contributions of the mutations in the light chain variable region (VL) and the heavy chain variable region (VH) domains and of the H-CDR3 in the autoreactivity of two IgM rheumatoid factors (RF), one a polyreactive low affinity Ab, the other a monoreactive high affinity Ab. These two RFs derived from the same V kappa III (humkv325) and VH1 (51p1) genes, but differed from each other by a few mutations and by the structure of the H-CDR3. The analysis of the reactivity patterns of different combinations of wild-type and in vitro engineered hybrid gene products clearly demonstrates the main influence of the H-CDR3 in the autoAb activity profiles. The results directly demonstrate the previously proposed hypothesis, namely, that the H-CDR3 plays a critical role in distinguishing poly- from monospecific RF. However, the data also indicate that self polyreactivity is a very fragile property and is dependent upon the primary structure of the VH segment.},

abstract = {B lymphocytes committed to the production of antibodies binding to antigens on pathogenic bacteria and viruses (natural antibodies) are common components of the normal human B cell repertoire. A major proportion of natural antibodies is capable of binding multiple antigens (polyreactive antibodies). Using B cells from three HIV-1 seronegative healthy subjects, and purified HIV-1 and beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli as selecting antigen, we generated three natural IgM mAb to HIV-1 and a natural IgM mAb to beta-galactosidase. The three HIV-1-selected antibodies (mAb102, mAb103, and mAb104) were polyreactive. They bound with different affinities (Kd = 10(-6) to 10(-8) M) to the HIV-1 envelope gp160, the p24 core protein, and the p66 reverse transcriptase, but not to the 120 glycosylated env protein. They also bound to beta-galactosidase (Kd approximately 10(-7) M), tetanus toxoid, and various various self antigens. In contrast, the natural mAb selected for binding to beta-galactosidase (mAb207.F1) was monoreactive, in that it bound with a high affinity (Kd < 10(-8) M) to this antigen, but to none of the other antigens tested, including HIV-1. Structural analysis of the VH and VL segments revealed that the natural mAb utilized three segments of the VHIV gene family and one of the VHIII family, in conjunction with VL segments of the V lambda I, V lambda II, V lambda III, or V kappa IV subgroups. In addition, the natural mAb VH and VL segments were in unmutated or virtually unmutated (germline) configuration, including those of the monoreactive mAb207.F1 to beta-galactosidase, and were identical or closely related to those utilized by specific autoantibodies or specific antibodies to viral and/or bacterial pathogens. Thus, the present data show that both polyreactive and monoreactive natural antibodies to foreign antigen can be isolated from the normal human B cell repertoire. They also suggest that the VH and VL segments of not only polyreactive but also monoreactive natural antibodies can be encoded in unmutated or minimally mutated genes, and possibly provide the templates for the specific high affinity antibodies elicited by self or foreign antigens.},

abstract = {Monomeric HIV envelope vaccines fail to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies or to protect against infection. Neutralizing antibodies against HIV bind to native functionally active Env trimers on the virion surface. Gag-Env pseudovirions recapitulate the native trimer and could serve as an effective epitope presentation platform for study of the neutralizing antibody response in HIV-infected individuals. To address if pseudovirions can recapitulate native HIV virion epitope structures, we carefully characterized these particles, concentrating on the antigenic structure of the coreceptor binding site. By blue native gel shift assays, Gag-Env pseudovirions were shown to contain native trimers that were competent for binding to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, pseudovirions exhibited increased binding of known CD4-induced antibodies after addition of CD4. Using flow cytometric analysis, fluorescently labeled pseudovirions specifically identified a subset of antigen-specific B cells in HIV-infected subjects. Interestingly, the sequence of one of these novel human antibodies, identified during cloning of single HIV-specific B cells and designated 2C6, exhibited homology to mAb 47e, a known anti-CD4-induced coreceptor binding site antibody. The secreted monoclonal antibody 2C6 did not bind monomeric gp120, but specifically bound envelope on pseudovirions. A recombinant form of the antibody 2C6 acted as a CD4-induced epitope-specific antibody in neutralization assays, yet did not bind monomeric gp120. These findings imply specificity against a quaternary epitope presented on the pseudovirion envelope spike. These data demonstrate that Gag-Env pseudovirions recapitulate CD4 and coreceptor binding pocket antigenic structures and can facilitate identification of B-cell clones that secrete neutralizing antibodies.},

Here we demonstrate the elicitation of structure-specific antibodies against the HIV-1 gp41 epitope of the broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5. This conformationally flexible region of gp41 assumes mostly helical conformations but adopts a kinked, extended structure when bound by antibody 2F5. Computational techniques were employed to transplant the 2F5 epitope into select acceptor scaffolds. The resultant "2F5-epitope scaffolds" possessed nanomolar affinity for antibody 2F5 and a range of epitope flexibilities and antigenic specificities. Crystallographic characterization of the epitope scaffold with highest affinity and antigenic discrimination confirmed good to near perfect attainment of the target conformation for the gp41 molecular graft in free and 2F5-bound states, respectively. Animals immunized with 2F5-epitope scaffolds showed levels of graft-specific immune responses that correlated with graft flexibility (p < 0.04), while antibody responses against the graft-as dissected residue-by-residue with alanine substitutions-resembled more closely those of 2F5 than sera elicited with flexible or cyclized peptides, a resemblance heightened by heterologous prime-boost. Lastly, crystal structures of a gp41 peptide in complex with monoclonal antibodies elicited by the 2F5-epitope scaffolds revealed that the elicited antibodies induce gp41 to assume its 2F5-recognized shape. Epitope scaffolds thus provide a means to elicit antibodies that recognize a predetermined target shape and sequence, even if that shape is transient in nature, and a means by which to dissect factors influencing such elicitation.},

abstract = {We describe predictions made using the Rosetta structure prediction methodology for both template-based modeling and free modeling categories in the Seventh Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction. For the first time, aggressive sampling and all-atom refinement could be carried out for the majority of targets, an advance enabled by the Rosetta@home distributed computing network. Template-based modeling predictions using an iterative refinement algorithm improved over the best existing templates for the majority of proteins with less than 200 residues. Free modeling methods gave near-atomic accuracy predictions for several targets under 100 residues from all secondary structure classes. These results indicate that refinement with an all-atom energy function, although computationally expensive, is a powerful method for obtaining accurate structure predictions.},

abstract = {Most of the methods that have been developed for computational protein design involve the selection of side-chain conformations in the context of a single, fixed main-chain structure. In contrast, multistate design (MSD) methods allow sequence selection to be driven by the energetic contributions of multiple structural or chemical states simultaneously. This methodology is expected to be useful when the design target is an ensemble of related states rather than a single structure, or when a protein sequence must assume several distinct conformations to function. MSD can also be used with explicit negative design to suggest sequences with altered structural, binding, or catalytic specificity. We report implementation details of an efficient multistate design optimization algorithm based on FASTER (MSD-FASTER). We subjected the algorithm to a battery of computational tests and found it to be generally applicable to various multistate design problems; designs with a large number of states and many designed positions are completely feasible. A direct comparison of MSD-FASTER and multistate design Monte Carlo indicated that MSD-FASTER discovers low-energy sequences much more consistently. MSD-FASTER likely performs better because amino acid substitutions are chosen on an energetic basis rather than randomly, and because multiple substitutions are applied together. Through its greater efficiency, MSD-FASTER should allow protein designers to test experimentally better-scoring sequences, and thus accelerate progress in the development of improved scoring functions and models for computational protein design.},

Using a systematic approach, we have examined neutralization breadth in the sera of about 1800 HIV-1-infected individuals, primarily infected with non-clade B viruses, and have selected donors for monoclonal antibody (mAb) generation. We then used a high-throughput neutralization screen of antibody-containing culture supernatants from about 30,000 activated memory B cells from a clade A-infected African donor to isolate two potent mAbs that target a broadly neutralizing epitope. This epitope is preferentially expressed on trimeric Envelope protein and spans conserved regions of variable loops of the gp120 subunit. The results provide a framework for the design of new vaccine candidates for the elicitation of bNAb responses.},

A major difference between the two forms is a pronounced loss of mass from the "peak" of the native Env spike. The apparent loss of contact among three gp120 protomers likely accounts for the more open structure, heterogeneity in configuration, and previous observations that broadly neutralizing epitopes and reactive sites on other structural elements are more exposed in such constructs.},

abstract = {Miniproteins provide a bridge between proteins and small molecules. Here we adapt methods from combinatorial chemistry to optimize CD4M33, a synthetic miniprotein into which we had previously transplanted the HIV-1 gp120 binding surface of the CD4 receptor. Iterative deconvolution of generated libraries produced CD4M47, a derivative of CD4M33 that had been optimized at four positions. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated fourfold to sixfold improvement in CD4M47 affinity for gp120 to a level about threefold tighter than that of CD4 itself. Assessment of the neutralization properties of CD4M47 against a diverse range of isolates spanning from HIV-1 to SIVcpz showed that CD4M47 retained the extraordinary breadth of the parent CD4M33, but yielded only limited improvements in neutralization potencies. Crystal structures of CD4M47 and a phenylalanine variant ([Phe23]M47) were determined at resolutions of 2.4 and 2.6 A, in ternary complexes with HIV-1 gp120 and the 17b antibody. Analysis of these structures revealed a correlation between mimetic affinity for gp120 and overall mimetic-gp120 interactive surface. A correlation was also observed between CD4- and mimetic-induced gp120 structural similarity and CD4- and mimetic-induced gp120 affinity for the CCR5 coreceptor. Despite mimetic substitutions, including a glycine-to-(d)-proline change, the gp120 conformation induced by CD4M47 was as close or closer to the conformation induced by CD4 as the one induced by the parent CD4M33. Our results demonstrate the ability of combinatorial chemistry to optimize a disulfide-containing miniprotein, and of structural biology to decipher the resultant interplay between binding affinity, neutralization breadth, molecular mimicry, and induced affinity for CCR5.},

abstract = {Induction of broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies is a high priority for AIDS vaccine development but one that has proven difficult to be achieved. While most immunogens generate antibodies that neutralize a subset of T-cell-line-adapted strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), none so far have generated a potent, broadly cross-reactive response against primary isolates of the virus. Even small increments in immunogen improvement leading to increases in neutralizing antibody titers and cross-neutralizing activity would accelerate vaccine development; however, a lack of uniformity in target strains used by different investigators to assess cross-neutralization has made the comparison of vaccine-induced antibody responses difficult. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish standard panels of HIV-1 reference strains for wide distribution. To facilitate this, full-length gp160 genes were cloned from acute and early subtype B infections and characterized for use as reference reagents to assess neutralizing antibodies against clade B HIV-1. Individual gp160 clones were screened for infectivity as Env-pseudotyped viruses in a luciferase reporter gene assay in JC53-BL (TZM-bl) cells. Functional env clones were sequenced and their neutralization phenotypes characterized by using soluble CD4, monoclonal antibodies, and serum samples from infected individuals and noninfected recipients of a recombinant gp120 vaccine. Env clones from 12 R5 primary HIV-1 isolates were selected that were not unusually sensitive or resistant to neutralization and comprised a wide spectrum of genetic, antigenic, and geographic diversity. These reference reagents will facilitate proficiency testing and other validation efforts aimed at improving assay performance across laboratories and can be used for standardized assessments of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies.},

These structures are compared with the corresponding crystal structures of the affinity-matured antibody, 48G7, which has a 30,000 times higher affinity for hapten as a result of nine replacement somatic mutations. Significant changes in the configuration of the combining site occur upon binding of hapten to the germline antibody, whereas hapten binds to the mature antibody by a lock-and-key fit mechanism. The reorganization of the combining site that was nucleated by hapten binding is further optimized by somatic mutations that occur up to 15  from bound hapten. These results suggest that the binding potential of the primary antibody repertoire may be significantly expanded by the ability of germline antibodies to adopt more than one combining-site configuration, with both antigen binding and somatic mutation stabilizing the configuration with optimal hapten complementarity.},

abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, possesses conserved binding sites for interaction with the primary virus receptor, CD4, and also for the co-receptor, generally CCR5. Although gp120 is a major target for virus-specific neutralizing antibodies, the gp120 variable elements and its malleable nature contribute to evasion of effective host-neutralizing antibodies. To understand the conformational character and immunogenicity of the gp120 receptor binding sites as potential vaccine targets, we introduced structure-based modifications to stabilize gp120 core proteins (deleted of the gp120 major variable regions) into the conformation recognized by both receptors. Thermodynamic analysis of the re-engineered core with selected ligands revealed significant stabilization of the receptor-binding regions. Stabilization of the co-receptor-binding region was associated with a marked increase in on-rate of ligand binding to this site as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Rabbit immunization studies showed that the conformational stabilization of core proteins, along with increased ligand affinity, was associated with strikingly enhanced humoral immune responses against the co-receptor-binding site. These results demonstrate that structure-based approaches can be exploited to stabilize a conformational site in a large functional protein to enhance immunogenic responses specific for that region.},

abstract = {The remarkable diversity, glycosylation and conformational flexibility of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env), including substantial rearrangement of the gp120 glycoprotein upon binding the CD4 receptor, allow it to evade antibody-mediated neutralization. Despite this complexity, the HIV-1 Env must retain conserved determinants that mediate CD4 binding. To evaluate how these determinants might provide opportunities for antibody recognition, we created variants of gp120 stabilized in the CD4-bound state, assessed binding of CD4 and of receptor-binding-site antibodies, and determined the structure at 2.3 angstrom resolution of the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 in complex with gp120. b12 binds to a conformationally invariant surface that overlaps a distinct subset of the CD4-binding site. This surface is involved in the metastable attachment of CD4, before the gp120 rearrangement required for stable engagement. A site of vulnerability, related to a functional requirement for efficient association with CD4, can therefore be targeted by antibody to neutralize HIV-1.},

The extended nature and antibody accessibility of V3 explain its immunodominance. Together, the results provide a structural rationale for the role of V3 in HIV entry and neutralization.},

abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 establishes persistent infections in humans which lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, are assembled into a trimeric complex that mediates virus entry into target cells. HIV-1 entry depends on the sequential interaction of the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein with the receptors on the cell, CD4 and members of the chemokine receptor family. The gp120 glycoprotein, which can be shed from the envelope complex, elicits both virus-neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies during natural infection. Antibodies that lack neutralizing activity are often directed against the gp120 regions that are occluded on the assembled trimer and which are exposed only upon shedding. Neutralizing antibodies, by contrast, must access the functional envelope glycoprotein complex and typically recognize conserved or variable epitopes near the receptor-binding regions. Here we describe the spatial organization of conserved neutralization epitopes on gp120, using epitope maps in conjunction with the X-ray crystal structure of a ternary complex that includes a gp120 core, CD4 and a neutralizing antibody. A large fraction of the predicted accessible surface of gp120 in the trimer is composed of variable, heavily glycosylated core and loop structures that surround the receptor-binding regions. Understanding the structural basis for the ability of HIV-1 to evade the humoral immune response should assist in the design of a vaccine.},

abstract = {Anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibodies whose binding to gp120 is enhanced by CD4 binding (CD4i antibodies) are generally considered nonneutralizing for primary HIV-1 isolates. However, a novel CD4i-specific Fab fragment, X5, has recently been found to neutralize a wide range of primary isolates. To investigate the precise nature of the extraordinary neutralizing ability of Fab X5, we evaluated the abilities of different forms (immunoglobulin G [IgG], Fab, and single-chain Fv) of X5 and other CD4i monoclonal antibodies to neutralize a range of primary HIV-1 isolates. Our results show that, for a number of isolates, the size of the neutralizing agent is inversely correlated with its ability to neutralize. Thus, the poor ability of CD4i-specific antibodies to neutralize primary isolates is due, at least in part, to steric factors that limit antibody access to the gp120 epitopes. Studies of temperature-regulated neutralization or fusion-arrested intermediates suggest that the steric effects are important in limiting the binding of IgG to the viral envelope glycoproteins after HIV-1 has engaged CD4 on the target cell membrane. The results identify hurdles in using CD4i epitopes as targets for antibody-mediated neutralization in vaccine design but also indicate that the CD4i regions could be efficiently targeted by small molecule entry inhibitors.},

abstract = {The ability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) to persist and cause AIDS is dependent on its avoidance of antibody-mediated neutralization. The virus elicits abundant, envelope-directed antibodies that have little neutralization capacity. This lack of neutralization is paradoxical, given the functional conservation and exposure of receptor-binding sites on the gp120 envelope glycoprotein, which are larger than the typical antibody footprint and should therefore be accessible for antibody binding. Because gp120-receptor interactions involve conformational reorganization, we measured the entropies of binding for 20 gp120-reactive antibodies. Here we show that recognition by receptor-binding-site antibodies induces conformational change. Correlation with neutralization potency and analysis of receptor-antibody thermodynamic cycles suggested a receptor-binding-site 'conformational masking' mechanism of neutralization escape. To understand how such an escape mechanism would be compatible with virus-receptor interactions, we tested a soluble dodecameric receptor molecule and found that it neutralized primary HIV-1 isolates with great potency, showing that simultaneous binding of viral envelope glycoproteins by multiple receptors creates sufficient avidity to compensate for such masking. Because this solution is available for cell-surface receptors but not for most antibodies, conformational masking enables HIV-1 to maintain receptor binding and simultaneously to resist neutralization.},

The structure reveals an extended CDR H3 loop with a phenylalanine residue at the apex and shows a striking pattern of serine and tyrosine residues. Modeling the interaction between gp120 and F105 suggests that the phenylalanine may recognize the binding pocket of gp120 used by Phe(43) of CD4 and that numerous tyrosine and serine residues form hydrogen bonds with the main chain atoms of gp120. A comparison of the F105 structure to that of immunoglobulin G1 b12, a much more potent and broadly neutralizing antibody with an overlapping epitope, suggests similarities that contribute to the broad recognition of human immunodeficiency virus by both antibodies. While the putative epitope for F105 shows significant overlap with that predicted for b12, it appears to differ from the b12 epitope in extending across the interface between the inner and outer domains of gp120. In contrast, the CDR loops of b12 appear to interact predominantly with the outer domain of gp120. The difference between the predicted epitopes for b12 and F105 suggests that the unique potency of b12 may arise from its ability to avoid the interface between the inner and outer domains of gp120.},

Its N terminus is tyrosine-sulfated, as are many antibodies that react with the co-receptor binding site on gp120. We applied nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic techniques to analyze the structure of the CCR5 N terminus and that of the tyrosine-sulfated antibody 412d in complex with gp120 and CD4. The conformations of tyrosine-sulfated regions of CCR5 (alpha-helix) and 412d (extended loop) are surprisingly different. Nonetheless, a critical sulfotyrosine on CCR5 and on 412d induces similar structural rearrangements in gp120. These results now provide a framework for understanding HIV-1 interactions with the CCR5 N terminus during viral entry and define a conserved site on gp120, whose recognition of sulfotyrosine engenders posttranslational mimicry by the immune system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 binds sequentially to CD4 and chemokine receptors on cells to initiate virus entry. During natural infection, gp120 is a primary target of the humoral immune response, and it has evolved to resist antibody-mediated neutralization. We previously reported the structure at 2.5 A of a gp120 core from the HXBc2 laboratory-adapted isolate in complex with a 2 domain fragment of CD4 and the antigen binding fragment of a human antibody. This revealed atomic details of gp120-receptor interactions and suggested multiple mechanisms of immune evasion. RESULTS: We have now extended the HXBc2 structure in P222, crystals to 2.2 A. The enhanced resolution enabled a more accurate modeling of less-well-ordered regions and provided conclusive identification of the density in the central cavity at the crux of the gp120-CD4 interaction as isopropanol from the crystallization medium. We have also determined the structure of a gp120 core from the primary clinical HIV-1 isolate, YU2, in the same ternary complex but in a C2 crystal lattice. Comparisons of HXBc2 and YU2 showed that while CD4 binding was rigid, portions of the gp120 core were conformationally flexible; overall differences were minor, with sequence changes concentrated on a surface expected to be exposed on the envelope oligomer. CONCLUSIONS: Despite dramatic antigenic differences between primary and laboratory-adapted HIV-1, the gp120 cores from these isolates are remarkably similar. Taken together with chimeric substitution and sequence analysis, this indicates that neutralization resistance is specified by quaternary interactions involving the major variable loops and thus affords a mechanism for viral adaptation. Conservation of the central cavity suggests the possibility of therapeutic inhibitors. The structures reported here extend in detail and generality our understanding of the biology of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein.},

abstract = {HIV infection is initiated by the selective interaction between the cellular receptor CD4 and gp120, the external envelope glycoprotein of the virus. We used analytical ultracentrifugation, titration calorimetry, and surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis to characterize the assembly state, thermodynamics, and kinetics of the CD4-gp120 interaction. The binding thermodynamics were of unexpected magnitude; changes in enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity greatly exceeded those described for typical protein-protein interactions. These unusual thermodynamic properties were observed with both intact gp120 and a deglycosylated and truncated form of gp120 protein that lacked hypervariable loops V1, V2, and V3 and segments of its N and C termini. Together with previous crystallographic studies, the large changes in heat capacity and entropy reveal that extensive structural rearrangements occur within the core of gp120 upon CD4 binding. CD spectral studies and slow kinetics of binding support this conclusion. These results indicate considerable conformational flexibility within gp120, which may relate to viral mechanisms for triggering infection and disguising conserved receptor-binding sites from the immune system.},

abstract = {Variable regions 1 and 2 (V1/V2) of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) gp120 envelope glycoprotein are critical for viral evasion of antibody neutralization, and are themselves protected by extraordinary sequence diversity and N-linked glycosylation. Human antibodies such as PG9 nonetheless engage V1/V2 and neutralize 80% of HIV-1 isolates. Here we report the structure of V1/V2 in complex with PG9. V1/V2 forms a four-stranded $\beta$-sheet domain, in which sequence diversity and glycosylation are largely segregated to strand-connecting loops. PG9 recognition involves electrostatic, sequence-independent and glycan interactions: the latter account for over half the interactive surface but are of sufficiently weak affinity to avoid autoreactivity. The structures of V1/V2-directed antibodies CH04 and PGT145 indicate that they share a common mode of glycan penetration by extended anionic loops. In addition to structurally defining V1/V2, the results thus identify a paradigm of antibody recognition for highly glycosylated antigens, which-with PG9-involves a site of vulnerability comprising just two glycans and a strand.},

abstract = {The glycoprotein (gp) 120 subunit is an important part of the envelope spikes that decorate the surface of HIV-1 and a major target for neutralizing antibodies. However, immunization with recombinant gp120 does not elicit neutralizing antibodies against multiple HIV-1 isolates (broadly neutralizing antibodies), and gp120 failed to demonstrate vaccine efficacy in recent clinical trials. Ongoing crystallographic studies of gp120 molecules from HIV-1 and SIV increasingly reveal how conserved regions, which are the targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies, are concealed from immune recognition. Based on this structural insight and that from studies of antibody structures, a number of strategies are being pursued to design immunogens that can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies to gp120. These include (a) the construction of mimics of the viral envelope spike and (b) the design of antigens specifically tailored to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies.},

abstract = {The ability to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies should be a key component of any forthcoming vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus type 1. One potential vaccine candidate, monomeric gp120, has generally failed to elicit such antibodies. We postulated that gp120 might be a better immunogen if it could be engineered to preferentially bind known broadly neutralizing antibodies. In a first study, we found that four alanine substitutions on the perimeter of the so-called Phe-43 cavity of gp120 could reduce binding of weakly neutralizing CD4-binding site antibodies (R. Pantophlet, E. O. Saphire, P. Poignard, P. W. H. I. Parren, I. A. Wilson, and D. R. Burton, J. Virol. 77:642-658, 2003), while slightly enhancing binding of the potent, broadly neutralizing antibody b12. In the present study, we sought to reduce or abolish the binding of a wider range of nonneutralizing antibodies, by incorporating extra N-glycosylation motifs at select positions into the hypervariable loops and the gp120 core. A hyperglycosylated mutant containing seven extra glycosylation sequons (consensus sequences) and the four alanine substitutions described above did not bind an extensive panel of nonneutralizing and weakly neutralizing antibodies, including a polyclonal immunoglobulin preparation (HIVIG) of low neutralizing potency. Binding of b12, at lowered affinity, and of four antibodies to the C1 and C5 regions was maintained. Removal of N- and C-terminal residues in the C1 and C5 regions, respectively, reduced or abolished binding of the four antibodies, but this also adversely affected b12 binding. The hyperglycosylated mutant and its analogues described here are novel antigens that may provide a new approach to eliciting antibodies with b12-like neutralizing properties.},

A key feature of the antibody-combining site is the protruding, finger-like long CDR H3 that can penetrate the recessed CD4-binding site of gp120. A docking model of b12 and gp120 reveals severe structural constraints that explain the extraordinary challenge in eliciting effective neutralizing antibodies similar to b12. The structure, together with mutagenesis studies, provides a rationale for the extensive cross-reactivity of b12 and a valuable framework for the design of HIV-1 vaccines capable of eliciting b12-like activity.},

abstract = {The development of a rapid and efficient system to identify human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals with broad and potent HIV-1-specific neutralizing antibody responses is an important step toward the discovery of critical neutralization targets for rational AIDS vaccine design. In this study, samples from HIV-1-infected volunteers from diverse epidemiological regions were screened for neutralization responses using pseudovirus panels composed of clades A, B, C, and D and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). Initially, 463 serum and plasma samples from Australia, Rwanda, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and Zambia were screened to explore neutralization patterns and selection ranking algorithms. Samples were identified that neutralized representative isolates from at least four clade/CRF groups with titers above prespecified thresholds and ranked based on a weighted average of their log-transformed neutralization titers. Linear regression methods selected a five-pseudovirus subset, representing clades A, B, and C and one CRF01_AE, that could identify top-ranking samples with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) neutralization titers of >or=100 to multiple isolates within at least four clade groups. This reduced panel was then used to screen 1,234 new samples from the Ivory Coast, Kenya, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States, and 1% were identified as elite neutralizers. Elite activity is defined as the ability to neutralize, on average, more than one pseudovirus at an IC(50) titer of 300 within a clade group and across at least four clade groups. These elite neutralizers provide promising starting material for the isolation of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to assist in HIV-1 vaccine design.},

It is recognized that vaccine-induced antibody performance, as assessed in the available neutralization assays, may well serve as a "gatekeeper" for HIV-1 subunit vaccine prioritization and advancement. As a result, development of a standardized platform for reproducible measurement of neutralizing antibodies has received considerable attention. Here we review current advancements in our knowledge of the performance of different types of antibodies in a traditional primary cell neutralization assay and the newer, more standardized TZM-bl reporter cell line assay. In light of recently revealed differences (see accompanying article) in the results obtained in these two neutralization formats, parallel evaluation with both platforms should be contemplated as an interim solution until a better understanding of immune correlates of protection is achieved.},

abstract = {The conventional wisdom suggests that "constant" rather than "variable" regions of the HIV envelope (Env) glycoproteins would induce the most broadly reactive antibodies (Abs). However, of the several epitopes in the conserved regions of gp120 and gp41 that induce neutralizing Abs, all are well-protected by protein folding, glycosylation, and/or oligomerization of the Env proteins on the virus surface; most are only transiently exposed during the process of infection or are poorly immunogenic. In contrast, the third variable region (V3) of gp120 appears to be at least partially exposed during various stages of the infectious process, is immunogenic in essentially all HIV+ subjects, and is capable of inducing Abs able to neutralize a broad array of primary isolates. While these Abs were originally thought to be isolate-specific, a large body of data now shows that anti-V3 Abs from HIV-infected individuals indeed show intra- and inter-clade cross-reactivity with respect to both binding to diverse gp120 molecules and neutralization of many primary isolates. This cross-reactivity of anti-V3 Abs is counter-intuitive if one focuses on the sequence variability rather than on the conserved V3 structures which must be present in order to allow this region of the virus envelope to mediate selection of and interaction with chemokine receptors. Current data, summarized here, support the hypothesis that the V3 region of gp120 can induce broadly-reactive, cross-neutralizing Abs and as such should constitute a prominent target of the immune response induced with an HIV vaccine.},

abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1, HTLV-III/LAV), the retrovirus responsible for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), shows a high degree of genetic polymorphism, particularly in the env gene. We have examined sera from rabbits and guinea pigs immunized with gp130, a recombinant env glycoprotein, and sera from HIV-1-infected subjects, to test their capacity to neutralize a panel of genetically divergent HIV-1 isolates. The sera raised against recombinant antigen specifically neutralized the virus strain from which the env gene was cloned (HTLV-IIIB), but not an independent isolate (HTLV-IIIRF). One rabbit serum tested on seven isolates cross-neutralized two at lower titres. In contrast, human sera from Britain and Uganda, chosen for ability to neutralize HTLV-IIIRF, cross-neutralized six other HIV-1 isolates. When serum and isolate were derived from the same subject, the serum was in some cases effective at slightly lower concentrations (higher titres). Human complement did not affect neutralization titres. These findings indicate that genetically diverse HIV-1 isolates carry both variable and widely conserved antigenic epitopes for neutralizing antibodies. The identification of shared epitopes may help the development of protective vaccines.},

abstract = {Successful vaccines (i.e., tetanus and diphtheria) can induce long-lived Ab levels that are maintained by bone marrow plasma cells and plasma Ab levels do not correlate with numbers of blood memory B cells. Destruction of CD4(+) T cells early in HIV-1 acute infection may result in insufficient induction of neutralizing Ab responses; thus, an HIV-1 vaccine should elicit high levels of durable Abs by long-lived plasma cells to be protective. We asked if HIV-1 envelope-specific memory responses were sustained by memory B cells in the settings of HIV-1 gp120 envelope vaccination and chronic HIV-1 infection. Levels of anti-HIV-1 envelope plasma Abs and memory B cells were found to correlate in both settings. Moreover, whereas the expected half-life of plasma Ab levels to protein vaccines was >10 years when maintained by long-lived plasma cells, anti-envelope Ab level half-lives were approximately 33-81 wk in plasma from antiretroviral drug-treated HIV-1(+) subjects. In contrast, anti-p55 Gag Ab level half-life was 648 wk, and Ab titers against influenza did not decay in-between yearly or biennial influenza vaccine boosts in the same patients. These data demonstrated that HIV-1 envelope induces predominantly short-lived memory B cell-dependent plasma Abs in the settings of envelope vaccination and HIV-1 infection. The inability to generate high titers of long-lived anti-envelope Abs is a major hurdle to overcome for the development of a successful HIV-1 vaccine.},

Binley, T. Wrin, B. Korber, M.B. Zwick, M. Wang, C. Chappey, G. Stiegler, R. Kunert, S. Zolla-Pazner, H. Katinger, C.J. Petropoulos, D.R. Burton, Comprehensive cross-clade neutralization analysis of a panel of anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 monoclonal antibodies, J. Virol. 78 (2004) 13232-13252]. It has been hypothesized that the lower CCR5 concentration on the surface of the CD4 T lymphocytes compared to that on cell lines used for the neutralization assays could be a contributing factor to the observed differences in neutralizing activity. To test this hypothesis and to further elucidate the contribution of CCR5 concentration differences on antibody neutralizing activity, we used a panel of HeLa cell lines with well-defined and differential surface concentrations of CCR5 and CD4 in a pseudovirus-based assay. We observed that the CCR5 cell surface concentration but not the CD4 concentration had a significant effect on the inhibitory activity of X5 and several other CD4i antibodies including 17b and m9, as well as that of the gp41-specifc antibodies 2F5 and 4E10 but not on that of the CD4 binding site antibody (CD4bs), b12. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) decreased up to two orders of magnitude in cell lines with low CCR5 concentration corresponding to that in CD4 T cells used in PBMC-based assays (about 10(3) per cell) compared to cell lines with high CCR5 concentration (about 10(4) or more). Our results suggest that the CCR5 cell surface concentration could be a contributing factor to the high neutralizing activities of some antibodies in PBMC-based-assays but other factors could also play an important role. These findings could have implications for development of vaccine immunogens based on the epitopes of X5 and other CD4i antibodies, for elucidation of the mechanisms of HIV-1 neutralization by antibodies, and for design of novel therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {Broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are potentially important tools in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine design. A few rare MAbs have been intensively studied, but we still have a limited appreciation of their neutralization breadth. Using a pseudovirus assay, we evaluated MAbs from clade B-infected donors and a clade B HIV(+) plasma against 93 viruses from diverse backgrounds. Anti-gp120 MAbs exhibited greater activity against clade B than non-B viruses, whereas anti-gp41 MAbs exhibited broad interclade activity. Unexpectedly, MAb 4E10 (directed against the C terminus of the gp41 ectodomain) neutralized all 90 viruses with moderate potency. MAb 2F5 (directed against an epitope adjacent to that of 4E10) neutralized 67% of isolates, but none from clade C. Anti-gp120 MAb b12 (directed against an epitope overlapping the CD4 binding site) neutralized 50% of viruses, including some from almost every clade. 2G12 (directed against a high-mannose epitope on gp120) neutralized 41% of the viruses, but none from clades C or E. MAbs to the gp120 V3 loop, including 447-52D, neutralized a subset of clade B viruses (up to 45%) but infrequently neutralized other clades (</=7%). MAbs b6 (directed against the CD4 binding site) and X5 (directed against a CD4-induced epitope of gp120) neutralized only sensitive primary clade B viruses. The HIV(+) plasma neutralized 70% of the viruses, including some from all major clades. Further analysis revealed five neutralizing immunotypes that were somewhat associated with clades. As well as the significance for vaccine design, our data have implications for passive-immunization studies in countries where clade C viruses are common, given that only MAbs b12 and 4E10 were effective against viruses from this clade.},

In order to establish if these antibodies were directly responsible for the observed neutralization breadth, we used MPER-coated magnetic beads to deplete plasmas of these specific antibodies. Depletion of anti-MPER antibodies from BB34, CAP206, and SAC21 resulted in 77%, 68%, and 46% decreases, respectively, in the number of viruses neutralized. Antibodies eluted from the beads showed neutralization profiles similar to those of the original plasmas, with potencies comparable to those of the known anti-MPER monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 4E10, 2F5, and Z13e1. The anti-MPER neutralizing antibodies in BB34 were present in the immunoglobulin G3 subclass-enriched fraction. Alanine scanning of the MPER showed that the antibodies from these three plasmas had specificities distinct from those of the known MAbs, requiring one to three crucial residues at positions 670, 673, and 674. These data demonstrate the existence of MPER-specific cross-neutralizing antibodies in plasma, although the ability to elicit such potent antiviral antibodies during natural infection appears to be rare. Nevertheless, the identification of three novel antibody specificities within the MPER supports its further study as a promising target for vaccine design.},

abstract = {Identifying the viral epitopes targeted by broad neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that sometimes develop in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected subjects should assist in the design of vaccines to elicit similar responses. Here, we investigated the activities of a panel of 24 broadly neutralizing plasmas from subtype B- and C-infected donors using a series of complementary mapping methods, focusing mostly on JR-FL as a prototype subtype B primary isolate. Adsorption with gp120 immobilized on beads revealed that an often large but variable fraction of plasma neutralization was directed to gp120 and that in some cases, neutralization was largely mediated by CD4 binding site (CD4bs) Abs. The results of a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay using JR-FL trimers further suggested that half of the subtype B and a smaller fraction of subtype C plasmas contained a significant proportion of NAbs directed to the CD4bs. Anti-gp41 neutralizing activity was detected in several plasmas of both subtypes, but in all but one case, constituted only a minor fraction of the overall neutralization activity. Assessment of the activities of the subtype B plasmas against chimeric HIV-2 viruses bearing various fragments of the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 gp41 revealed mixed patterns, implying that MPER neutralization was not dominated by any single specificity akin to known MPER-specific monoclonal Abs. V3 and 2G12-like NAbs appeared to make little or no contribution to JR-FL neutralization titers. Overall, we observed significant titers of anti-CD4bs NAbs in several plasmas, but approximately two-thirds of the neutralizing activity remained undefined, suggesting the existence of NAbs with specificities unlike any characterized to date.},

abstract = {The entry of primate immunodeficiency viruses into target cells depends on a sequential interaction of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein with the cellular receptors, CD4 and members of the chemokine receptor family. The gp120 third variable (V3) loop has been implicated in chemokine receptor binding, but the use of the CCR5 chemokine receptor by diverse primate immunodeficiency viruses suggests the involvement of an additional, conserved gp120 element. Through the use of gp120 mutants, a highly conserved gp120 structure was shown to be critical for CCR5 binding. This structure is located adjacent to the V3 loop and contains neutralization epitopes induced by CD4 binding. This conserved element may be a useful target for pharmacologic or prophylactic intervention in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections.},

abstract = {To understand the mechanisms that govern T cell receptor (TCR)-peptide MHC (pMHC) binding and the role that different regions of the TCR play in affinity and antigen specificity, we have studied the TCR from T cell clone 2C. High-affinity mutants of the 2C TCR that bind QL9-L(d) as a strong agonist were generated previously by site-directed mutagenesis of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 1beta, 2alpha, 3alpha, or 3beta. We performed isothermal titration calorimetry to assess whether they use similar thermodynamic mechanisms to achieve high affinity for QL9-L(d). Four of the five TCRs examined bound to QL9-L(d) in an enthalpically driven, entropically unfavorable manner. In contrast, the high-affinity CDR1beta mutant resembled the wild-type 2C TCR interaction, with favorable entropy. To assess fine specificity, we measured the binding and kinetics of these mutants for both QL9-L(d) and a single amino acid peptide variant of QL9, called QL9-Y5-L(d). While 2C and most of the mutants had equal or higher affinity for the Y5 variant than for QL9, mutant CDR1beta exhibited 8-fold lower affinity for Y5 compared to QL9. To examine possible structural correlates of the thermodynamic and fine specificity signatures of the TCRs, the structure of unliganded QL9-L(d) was solved and compared to structures of the 2C TCR/QL9-L(d) complex and three high-affinity TCR/QL9-L(d) complexes. Our findings show that the QL9-L(d) complex does not undergo major conformational changes upon binding. Thus, subtle changes in individual CDRs account for the diverse thermodynamic and kinetic binding mechanisms and for the different peptide fine specificities.},

Here, we show that a number of human antibodies directed against gp120 are tyrosine sulfated at their antigen binding sites. Like that of CCR5, antibody association with gp120 is dependent on sulfate moieties, enhanced by CD4, and inhibited by sulfated CCR5-derived peptides. Most of these antibodies preferentially associate with gp120 molecules of CCR5-utilizing (R5) isolates and neutralize primary R5 isolates more efficiently than laboratory-adapted isolates. These studies identify a distinct subset of CD4-induced HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies that closely emulate CCR5 and demonstrate that tyrosine sulfation can contribute to the potency and diversity of the human humoral response.},

abstract = {The process whereby the immune system generates antibodies of higher affinities during a response to antigen (affinity maturation) is a prototypical example of molecular evolution. Earlier studies have been confined to antibodies specific for small molecules (haptens) rather than for proteins. We compare the structures of four antibodies bound to the same site on hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) at different stages of affinity maturation. These X-ray snapshots reveal that binding is enhanced, not through the formation of additional hydrogen bonds or van der Waals contacts or by an increase in total buried surface, but by burial of increasing amounts of apolar surface at the expense of polar surface, accompanied by improved shape complementarity. The increase in hydrophobic interactions results from highly correlated rearrangements in antibody residues at the interface periphery, adjacent to the central energetic hot spot. This first visualization of the maturation of antibodies to protein provides insights into the evolution of high affinity in other protein-protein interfaces.},

Here, we report the crystal structure of the Fab fragment of Z13e1, an affinity-enhanced variant of monoclonal antibody Z13, in complex with a 12-residue peptide corresponding to the core epitope (W(670)NWFDITN(677)) at 1.8-A resolution. The bound peptide adopts an S-shaped conformation composed of two tandem, perpendicular helical turns. This conformation differs strikingly from the alpha-helical structure adopted by an overlapping MPER peptide bound to 4E10. Z13e1 binds to an elbow in the MPER at the membrane interface, making relatively few interactions with conserved aromatics (Trp672 and Phe673) that are critical for 4E10 recognition. The comparison of the Z13e1 and 4E10 epitope structures reveals a conformational switch such that neutralization can occur by the recognition of the different conformations and faces of the largely amphipathic MPER. The Z13e1 structure provides significant new insights into the dynamic nature of the MPER, which likely is critical for membrane fusion, and it has significant implications for mechanisms of HIV-1 neutralization by MPER antibodies and for the design of HIV-1 immunogens.},

abstract = {Most existing viral vaccines generate antibodies that either block initial infection or help eradicate the virus before it can cause disease. For HIV-1, obstacles to eliciting protective neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) have often seemed insurmountable. The target of HIV-specific NAbs, the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env), is highly variable in amino acid sequence and glycosylation pattern. Conserved elements of HIV-1 Env seem to be poorly immunogenic, and previous attempts to generate broadly reactive NAbs by vaccination have proven ineffective. However, recent studies show that antibodies in the sera of some HIV-1-infected individuals can neutralize diverse HIV-1 isolates. Detailed analyses of these sera provide new insights into the viral epitopes targeted by broadly reactive NAbs. The findings discussed here suggest that the natural NAb response to HIV-1 can inform future vaccine design. A concerted effort of structure-based vaccine design will help guide the development of improved antibody-based vaccines for HIV-1.},

However, even variable regions on the spike tend to be less antigenic and immunogenic than one might have anticipated for external structures. Here we show that the envelope spike of primary viruses has an ability to restrict antibody recognition of variable regions. We show that access to an artificial epitope, introduced at multiple positions across the spike, is frequently limited, even though the epitope has been inserted at surface-exposed regions on the spike. Based on the data, we posit that restricted antibody access may be the result, at least in part, of a rigidification of the epitope sequence in the context of the spike and/or a highly effective flexible arrangement of the glycan shield on primary viruses. Evolution of the HIV envelope structure to incorporate extra polypeptide sequences into nominally accessible regions with limited antibody recognition may contribute to reducing the magnitude of antibody responses during infection and allow the virus to replicate unhindered by antibody pressure for longer periods.},

abstract = {The region of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 that engages its primary cellular receptor CD4, forms a site of vulnerability to neutralizing antibodies. The monoclonal antibody b12 exploits the conservation and accessibility of the CD4-binding site to neutralize many, though not all HIV-1 isolates. To understand the basis of viral resistance to b12, we used the atomic-level definition of b12-gp120 contact sites to study a panel of diverse circulating viruses. A combination of sequence analysis, computational modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis were used to determine the influence of amino-acid variants on binding and neutralization by b12. We found that several substitutions within the dominant b12-contact surface, called the CD4-binding loop, mediated b12 resistance and that these substitutions resided just proximal to the known CD4-contact surface. Hence, viruses varied key b12-contact residues which are proximal to, but not part of, the CD4-contact surface. This explained how viral isolates were able to evade b12 neutralization while maintain functional binding to CD4. In addition, some viruses were resistant to b12 despite minimal sequence variation at b12-contact sites. Such neutralization resistance could usually be reversed by alterations at residues thought to influence the quaternary configuration of the viral envelope spike. To design immunogens that elicit neutralizing antibodies directed to the CD4-binding site, researchers will need to address the antigenic variation within this region of gp120, and the restricted access to the CD4-binding site imposed by the native configuration of the trimeric viral envelope spike.},

We designed a CD4 mutant (D1D2F43C) for site-specific coupling of compounds for screening against the cavity. Altogether, 81 cysteine-reactive compounds were designed, synthesized, and tested. Eight derivatives exceeded the affinity of native D1D2 for gp120. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) for derivatized CD4 binding to gp120 revealed significant plasticity of the Phe43 cavity and a narrow entrance. The primary contacts for compound recognition inside the cavity were found to be van der Waals interactions, whereas hydrophilic interactions were detected in the entrance. This first SAR on ligand binding to an interior cavity of gp120 may provide a starting point for structure-based assembly of small molecules targeting gp120-CD4 interaction.},

abstract = {The membrane-proximal region of the ectodomain of the gp41 envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the target of three of the five broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies thus far isolated. We have determined crystal structures of the antigen-binding fragment for one of these antibodies, 2F5, in complex with 7-mer, 11-mer, and 17-mer peptides of the gp41 membrane-proximal region, at 2.0-, 2.1-, and 2.2-A resolutions, respectively. The structures reveal an extended gp41 conformation, which stretches over 30 A in length. Contacts are made with five complementarity-determining regions of the antibody as well as with nonpolymorphic regions. Only one exclusive charged face of the gp41 epitope is bound by 2F5, while the nonbound face, which is hydrophobic, may be hidden due to occlusion by other portions of the ectodomain. The structures reveal that the 2F5 antibody is uniquely built to bind to an epitope that is proximal to a membrane surface and in a manner mostly unaffected by large-scale steric hindrance. Biochemical studies with proteoliposomes confirm the importance of lipid membrane and hydrophobic context in the binding of 2F5 as well as in the binding of 4E10, another broadly neutralizing antibody that recognizes the membrane-proximal region of gp41. Based on these structural and biochemical results, immunization strategies for eliciting 2F5- and 4E10-like broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies are proposed.},

abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, mediates receptor binding and is the major target for neutralizing antibodies. Primary HIV-1 isolates are characteristically more resistant to broadly neutralizing antibodies, although the structural basis for this resistance remains obscure. Most broadly neutralizing antibodies are directed against functionally conserved gp120 regions involved in binding to either the primary virus receptor, CD4, or the viral coreceptor molecules that normally function as chemokine receptors. These antibodies are known as CD4 binding site (CD4BS) and CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies, respectively. Inspection of the gp120 crystal structure reveals that although the receptor-binding regions lack glycosylation, sugar moieties lie proximal to both receptor-binding sites on gp120 and thus in proximity to both the CD4BS and the CD4i epitopes. In this study, guided by the X-ray crystal structure of gp120, we deleted four N-linked glycosylation sites that flank the receptor-binding regions. We examined the effects of selected changes on the sensitivity of two prototypic HIV-1 primary isolates to neutralization by antibodies. Surprisingly, removal of a single N-linked glycosylation site at the base of the gp120 third variable region (V3 loop) increased the sensitivity of the primary viruses to neutralization by CD4BS antibodies. Envelope glycoprotein oligomers on the cell surface derived from the V3 glycan-deficient virus were better recognized by a CD4BS antibody and a V3 loop antibody than were the wild-type glycoproteins. Absence of all four glycosylation sites rendered a primary isolate sensitive to CD4i antibody-mediated neutralization. Thus, carbohydrates that flank receptor-binding regions on gp120 protect primary HIV-1 isolates from antibody-mediated neutralization.},

We reasoned that a CD4-VH3 fusion protein could possess higher affinity for gp120 and improved HIV-1 inhibitory capacity. To test this we produced several human IgG1 immunoligands harboring VH3. Unlike VH3-IgG1 or VH3-CD4-IgG1, CD4-VH3-IgG1 bound gp120 considerably stronger than CD4-IgG1. CD4-VH3-IgG1 exhibited approximately 1.5-2.5-fold increase in neutralization of two T-cell laboratory-adapted strains when compared to CD4-IgG1. CD4-VH3-IgG1 improved neutralization of 7/10 clade B primary isolates or pseudoviruses, exceeding 20-fold for JR-FL and 13-fold for Ba-L. It enhanced neutralization of 4/8 clade C viruses, and had negligible effect on 1/4 clade A pseudoviruses. We attribute this improvement to possible pairing of VH3 with CD4 D1 and stabilization of an Ig Fv-like structure, rather than to superantigen interactions. These novel findings support the current notion that CD4 fusion proteins can act as better HIV-1 entry inhibitors with potential clinical implications.},

An important aspect of these efforts is an ability to achieve and document equivalent assay performance across multiple laboratories. Recent advances in assay technology have led to major improvements in how HIV NAbs are measured. Stable cell lines containing HIV Tat-regulated reporter genes are now available that permit rapid, sensitive and reproducible measurements of virus neutralization after a single round of infection in a high throughput format.Moreover, these assays may be used with molecularly cloned Env-pseudotyped viruses for greater reagent stability and traceability.A luciferase (Luc) reporter gene assay performed in TZM-bl (JC53bl-13) cells was recently optimized and many of its performance parameters have been validated. This assay has become the main endpoint neutralization assay used by the NIH-sponsored HIV Vaccine Trials Network and by a growing number of laboratories worldwide.},

abstract = {The precise identification of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) responsible for productive clinical infection could be instrumental in elucidating the molecular basis of HIV-1 transmission and in designing effective vaccines. Here, we developed a mathematical model of random viral evolution and, together with phylogenetic tree construction, used it to analyze 3,449 complete env sequences derived by single genome amplification from 102 subjects with acute HIV-1 (clade B) infection. Viral env genes evolving from individual transmitted or founder viruses generally exhibited a Poisson distribution of mutations and star-like phylogeny, which coalesced to an inferred consensus sequence at or near the estimated time of virus transmission. Overall, 78 of 102 subjects had evidence of productive clinical infection by a single virus, and 24 others had evidence of productive clinical infection by a minimum of two to five viruses. Phenotypic analysis of transmitted or early founder Envs revealed a consistent pattern of CCR5 dependence, masking of coreceptor binding regions, and equivalent or modestly enhanced resistance to the fusion inhibitor T1249 and broadly neutralizing antibodies compared with Envs from chronically infected subjects. Low multiplicity infection and limited viral evolution preceding peak viremia suggest a finite window of potential vulnerability of HIV-1 to vaccine-elicited immune responses, although phenotypic properties of transmitted Envs pose a formidable defense.},

abstract = {HIV has evolved many strategies to avoid neutralizing antibody responses, particularly to conserved regions on the external glycoprotein spikes of the virus. Nevertheless, a small number of antibodies have been evolved by the human immune system to recognize conserved parts of the glycoproteins, and therefore, have broadly neutralizing cross-strain activities. These antibodies constitute important tools in the quest to design immunogens that can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies in humans and hence contribute to an effective HIV vaccine. Crystallographic analyses of the antibodies, in many cases in an antigen-complexed form, have revealed novel and, in some instances, remarkable structural adaptations to attain virus recognition. Antibodies, like HIV, can evolve relatively rapidly through mutation and selection. It seems that the structures of these broadly neutralizing antibodies bear witness to a heroic struggle between two titans of rapid evolution.},

A crystal structure of a complex of 2F5 and a peptide corresponding to its core epitope on gp41, ELDKWAS, revealed that the peptide interacts with residues at the base of the unusually long (22-residue) third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain (CDR H3) but not the apex. Here, we perform alanine-scanning mutagenesis across CDR H3 and make additional substitutions of selected residues to map the paratope of Fab 2F5. Substitution of residues from the base of the H3 loop or from CDRs H1, H2, and L3, which are proximal to the peptide, significantly diminished the affinity of Fab 2F5 for gp41 and a short peptide containing the 2F5 core motif. However, nonconservative substitutions to a phenylalanine residue at the apex of the H3 loop also markedly decreased 2F5 binding to both gp41 and the peptide, suggesting that recognition of the core epitope is crucially dependent on features at the apex of the H3 loop. Furthermore, substitution at the apex of the H3 loop had an even more pronounced effect on the neutralizing activity of 2F5 against three sensitive HIV-1. These observations present a challenge to vaccine strategies based on peptide mimics of the linear epitope.},

abstract = {Alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed on monomeric gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to systematically identify residues important for gp120 recognition by neutralizing and nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs). Substitutions that affected the binding of broadly neutralizing antibody b12 were compared to substitutions that affected the binding of CD4 and of two nonneutralizing anti-CD4bs antibodies (b3 and b6) with affinities for monomeric gp120 comparable to that of b12. Not surprisingly, the sensitivities to a number of amino acid changes were similar for the MAbs and for CD4. However, in contrast to what was seen for the MAbs, no enhancing mutations were observed for CD4, suggesting that the virus has evolved toward an optimal gp120-CD4 interaction. Although the epitope maps of the MAbs overlapped, a number of key differences between b12 and the other two antibodies were observed. These differences may explain why b12, in contrast to nonneutralizing antibodies, is able to interact not only with monomeric gp120 but also with functional oligomeric gp120 at the virion surface. Neutralization assays performed with pseudovirions bearing envelopes from a selection of alanine mutants mostly showed a reasonable correlation between the effects of the mutations on b12 binding to monomeric gp120 and neutralization efficacy. However, some mutations produced an effect on b12 neutralization counter to that predicted from gp120 binding data. It appears that these mutations have different effects on the b12 epitope on monomeric gp120 and functional oligomeric gp120. To determine whether monomeric gp120 can be engineered to preferentially bind MAb b12, recombinant gp120s were generated containing combinations of alanine substitutions shown to uniquely enhance b12 binding. Whereas b12 binding was maintained or increased, binding by five nonneutralizing anti-CD4bs MAbs (b3, b6, F105, 15e, and F91) was reduced or completely abolished. These reengineered gp120s are prospective immunogens that may prove capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies.},

abstract = {IgG1 b12 is a broadly neutralizing antibody against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The epitope recognized by b12 overlaps the CD4 receptor-binding site (CD4bs) on gp120 and has been a target for vaccine design. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) b12 allowed modeling of the b12-gp120 interaction in which the protruding third complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the heavy chain (H3) was crucial for antibody binding. In the present study, extensive mutational analysis of the antigen-binding site of Fab b12 was carried out to investigate the validity of the model and to identify residues important for gp120 recognition and, by inference, key to the anti-HIV-1 activity of IgG1 b12. In all, 50 mutations were tested: 40 in H3, 4 each in H2 and L1, and 2 in L3. The results suggest that the interaction of gp120 with H3 of b12 is crucially dependent not only on a Trp residue at the apex of the H3 loop but also on a number of residues at the base of the loop. The arrangement of these residues, including aromatic side chains and side chains that hydrogen bond across the base of the loop, may rigidify H3 for penetration of the recessed CD4-binding cavity. The results further emphasize the importance to gp120 binding of a Tyr residue at the apex of the H2 loop that forms a second finger-like structure and a number of Arg residues in L1 that form a positively charged, shelf-like structure. In general, the data are consistent with the b12-gp120 interaction model previously proposed. At the gene level, somatic mutation is seen to be crucial for the generation of many of the structural features described. The Fab b12 mutants were also tested against the b12 epitope-mimic peptide B2.1, and the reactivity profile had many similarities but also significant differences from that observed for gp120. The paratope map of b12 may facilitate the design of molecules that are able to elicit b12-like activities.},

abstract = {The human antibody b12 recognizes a discontinuous epitope on gp120 and is one of the rare monoclonal antibodies that neutralize a broad range of primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. We previously reported the isolation of B2.1, a dimeric peptide that binds with high specificity to b12 and competes with gp120 for b12 antibody binding. Here, we show that the affinity of B2.1 was improved 60-fold over its synthetic-peptide counterpart by fusing it to the N terminus of a soluble protein. This affinity, which is within an order of magnitude of that of gp120, probably more closely reflects the affinity of the phage-borne peptide. The crystal structure of a complex between Fab of b12 and B2.1 was determined at 1.8 A resolution. The structural data allowed the differentiation of residues that form critical contacts with b12 from those required for maintenance of the antigenic structure of the peptide, and revealed that three contiguous residues mediate B2.1's critical contacts with b12. This single region of critical contact between the B2.1 peptide and the b12 paratope is unlikely to mimic the discontinuous key binding residues involved in the full b12 epitope for gp120, as previously identified by alanine scanning substitutions on the gp120 surface. These structural observations are supported by experiments that demonstrate that B2.1 is an ineffective immunogenic mimic of the b12 epitope on gp120. Indeed, an extensive series of immunizations with B2.1 in various forms failed to produce gp120 cross-reactive sera. The functional and structural data presented here, however, suggest that the mechanism by which b12 recognizes the two antigens is very different. Here, we present the first crystal structure of peptide bound to an antibody that was originally raised against a discontinuous protein epitope. Our results highlight the challenge of producing immunogens that mimic discontinuous protein epitopes, and the necessity of combining complementary experimental approaches in analyzing the antigenic and immunogenic properties of putative molecular mimics.},

abstract = {Neutralizing antibodies (Nab) are a principal component of an effective human immune response to many pathogens, yet their role in HIV-1 infection is unclear. To gain a better understanding of this role, we examined plasma from patients with acute HIV infection. Here we report the detection of autologous Nab as early as 52 days after detection of HIV-specific antibodies. The viral inhibitory activity of Nab resulted in complete replacement of neutralization-sensitive virus by successive populations of resistant virus. Escape virus contained mutations in the env gene that were unexpectedly sparse, did not map generally to known neutralization epitopes, and involved primarily changes in N-linked glycosylation. This pattern of escape, and the exceptional density of HIV-1 envelope glycosylation generally, led us to postulate an evolving 'glycan shield' mechanism of neutralization escape whereby selected changes in glycan packing prevent Nab binding but not receptor binding. Direct support for this model was obtained by mutational substitution showing that Nab-selected alterations in glycosylation conferred escape from both autologous antibody and epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. The evolving glycan shield thus represents a new mechanism contributing to HIV-1 persistence in the face of an evolving antibody repertoire.},

abstract = {Immunogenic, broadly reactive epitopes of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein could serve as important targets of the adaptive humoral immune response in natural infection and, potentially, as components of an acquired immune deficiency syndrome vaccine. However, variability in exposed epitopes and a combination of highly effective envelope-cloaking strategies have made the identification of such epitopes problematic. Here, we show that the chemokine coreceptor binding site of HIV-1 from clade A, B, C, D, F, G, and H and circulating recombinant form (CRF)01, CRF02, and CRF11, elicits high titers of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibody during natural human infection and that these antibodies bind and neutralize viruses as divergent as HIV-2 in the presence of soluble CD4 (sCD4). 178 out of 189 (94%) HIV-1-infected patients had CD4i antibodies that neutralized sCD4-pretreated HIV-2 in titers (50% inhibitory concentration) as high as 1:143,000. CD4i monoclonal antibodies elicited by HIV-1 infection also neutralized HIV-2 pretreated with sCD4, and polyclonal antibodies from HIV-1-infected humans competed specifically with such monoclonal antibodies for binding. In vivo, variants of HIV-1 with spontaneously exposed coreceptor binding surfaces were detected in human plasma; these viruses were neutralized directly by CD4i antibodies. Despite remarkable evolutionary diversity among primate lentiviruses, functional constraints on receptor binding create opportunities for broad humoral immune recognition, which in turn serves to constrain the viral quasispecies.},

Peptide linker sequences derived from the elbow regions of the Fab molecule were used alone or in combination with the flexible (GGGGS)2 sequence. VL and VH domain order in the single chain molecules had a profound effect on the level of secretion but hardly influenced total expression levels, which were approximately 50 mg/liter, chiefly in the form of inclusion bodies. With VL in the NH2-terminal position, the amount of secreted product obtained was 2.4 mg/liter, but when VH occupied this position the yield was less than 5% of this value. Enzyme immunoassays of the four products showed domain order and linker sequence affected antigen binding by less than an order of magnitude. Attempts to express active Fv from dicistronic DNA were unsuccessful, but active Fv was obtained from single-chain Fv by enzymic cleavage at a site in the elbow linker peptide.

The binding constant of the peptides and of SpA decreased with temperature and the binding process was connected with negative changes in enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity. The binding of the mimotopes to the Fab part of the IgG1 antibody and binding of SpA to the Fc part of the IgG1 antibody were mainly driven by hydrophobic effects and associated with a relatively large change in water-accessible surface area.

abstract = {We report the three-dimensional structures, at 1.8-A resolution, of the Fv fragment of the anti-hen egg white lysozyme antibody D1.3 in its free and antigen-bound forms. These structures reveal a role for solvent molecules in stabilizing the complex and provide a molecular basis for understanding the thermodynamic forces which drive the association reaction. Four water molecules are buried and others form a hydrogen-bonded network around the interface, bridging antigen and antibody. Comparison of the structures of free and bound Fv fragment of D1.3 reveals that several of the ordered water molecules in the free antibody combining site are retained and that additional water molecules link antigen and antibody upon complex formation. This solvation of the complex should weaken the hydrophobic effect, and the resulting large number of solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds, in conjunction with direct protein-protein interactions, should generate a significant enthalpic component. Furthermore, a stabilization of the relative mobilities of the antibody heavy- and light-chain variable domains and of that of the third complementarity-determining loop of the heavy chain seen in the complex should generate a negative entropic contribution opposing the enthalpic and the hydrophobic (solvent entropy) effects. This structural analysis is consistent with measurements of enthalpy and entropy changes by titration calorimetry, which show that enthalpy drives the antigen-antibody reaction. Thus, the main forces stabilizing the complex arise from antigen-antibody hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, enthalpy of hydration, and conformational stabilization rather than solvent entropy (hydrophobic) effects.},

If you change a conformation, you have to sample the conformation before you can react. this creates a poly-order reaction constant that will slow down the reaction rate because so many conformations have to be right at once. the enropy is also lowered in the bound state, as NMR experiments have gathered that bound amino acids can't sample as many vibraitonal states. },

abstract = {Antibodies bind protein antigens over large sterically and electrostatically complementary surfaces. Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, and occasionally ion pairs provide stability to antibody-antigen complexes. In addition, water molecules contribute hydrogen bonds linking antigen and antibody, and increase the complementarity of antigen-antibody interfaces. In qualification to a strict 'lock and key' mechanism, evidence of conformational changes between free and complexed antibodies indicate some accommodation to the antigen. Antibody-protein antigen reactions are enthalpically driven with varying degrees of entropic compensation, often dependent on the magnitude of the enthalpy of the reaction. In the case of two antibody-combining sites studied by X-ray diffraction, the relative arrangements of the variable domains of the light and heavy chains of the antibody change slightly from the free to the antigen-bound state. Furthermore, the contacting residues of both antibodies exhibit similar reduced mobilities when complexed to antigen, suggesting that differences in 'solvent entropy' rather than in conformational freedom may be the source of different entropic compensation factors. In concert, data from structural studies, reaction rates, calorimetric measurements, molecular dynamics simulations, and site-directed mutagenesis are beginning to detail the nature of antibody-protein antigen interactions.},

These observations show that the complex is considerably tolerant, both structurally and thermodynamically, to the truncation of antibody and antigen side chains that form contacts. Alterations in interface solvent structure for two of the mutant complexes appear to compensate for the unfavorable enthalpy changes when antibody-antigen interactions are removed. These changes in solvent structure, along with the increased mobility of side chains near the mutation site, probably contribute to the observed entropy compensation.

abstract = {The inhibitory switch (IS) domain of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) stabilizes full-length PAK1 in an inactive conformation by binding to the PAK1 kinase domain. Competitive binding of small guanosine triphosphatases to the IS domain disrupts the autoinhibitory interactions and exposes the IS domain binding site on the surface of the kinase domain. To build an affinity reagent that selectively binds the activated state of PAK1, we used molecular modeling to reengineer the isolated IS domain so that it was soluble and stable, did not bind to guanosine triphosphatases and bound more tightly to the PAK1 kinase domain. Three design strategies were tested: in the first and second cases, extension and redesign of the N-terminus were used to expand the hydrophobic core of the domain, and in the third case, the termini were redesigned to be adjacent in space so that the domain could be stabilized by insertion into a loop in a host cyan fluorescent protein (CFP). The best-performing design, called CFP-PAcKer, was based on the third strategy and bound the kinase domain of PAK1 with an affinity of 400 nM. CFP-PAcKer binds more tightly to a full-length variant of PAK1 that is stabilized in the "open" state (K(d)=3.3 $\mu$M) than to full-length PAK1 in the "closed" state (undetectable affinity), and binding can be monitored with fluorescence by placing an environmentally sensitive fluorescence dye on CFP-PAcKer adjacent to the binding site.},

Of the six hypervariable loops, the CDR3 of the heavy chain was selected for exhaustive study because of its significant contribution to binding-site topography. A total of 90 mutants were produced and screened by an affinity electrophoresis/Western blotting method. Those of particular interest were further characterized by enzyme immunoassay, and on this basis seven of the mutant Fabs were selected for thermodynamic characterization by titration microcalorimetry. With regard to residues that hydrogen bond to ligand through backbone interactions, Gly102H could not be substituted, while several side chains could be introduced at Gly100H and Tyr103H with relatively little effect on antigen binding. There was, however, a preference for nonpolar side chains at position 103H. Substitution of His101H with carboxylate and amide side chains gave mutants with binding affinities approaching that of the wild type; complete side-chain removal by mutation to Gly was tolerated with a 10-fold reduction in binding constant. Analysis of binding by titration microcalorimetry revealed some dramatic thermodynamic changes hidden by the similarity of the binding constants. Similar effects were observed with residue changes in an Arg-Asp salt-bridge at the base of the loop. These results indicate that alterations to higher affinity anti-carbohydrate antibodies are characterized by an enthalpy-entropy compensation factor which allows for fundamental changes in the nature of the binding interactions but impedes engineering for increases in affinity.},

Specificity for the 3,6-dideoxy-D-xylo-hexose (3,6-dideoxy-D-galactose) epitope present in Salmonella paratyphi B O-antigens was ensured by screening hybridoma experiments with glycoconjugates derived from synthetic oligosaccharides. Detailed epitope mapping of the molecular recognition by modified and monodeoxy oligosaccharide derivatives showed that complementary surfaces and three antibody-saccharide hydrogen bonds are essential for full binding activity. Both hydroxyl groups of the 3,6-dideoxy-D-galactose residue were obligatory for binding and consistent with the directional nature of their involvement in carbohydrate-protein hydrogen bonds; related tetrasaccharides built from the isomeric 3,6-dideoxyhexoses, 3,6-dideoxy-D-glucose, paratose, and 3,6-dideoxy-D-mannose, tyvelose were not bound by the antibody. Titration microcalorimetry measurements were consistent with the hydrogen-bonding map inferred from the crystal structure and suggest that the displacement of water molecules from the binding site accounts for the favorable entropy that accompanies binding of the native trisaccharide determinant. The protein sequences determined for the antibody VL and VH domains reveal somatic mutation of the VL germ line gene, implying that this antibody-binding site results from a mature antibody response.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are a ubiquitous mode of transmitting signals in cells and tissues. We are testing a stepwise, generic, structure-driven approach for finding low molecular weight inhibitors of protein-protein interactions. The approach requires development of a high-affinity, single chain antibody directed specifically against the interaction surface of one of the proteins to obtain structural information on the interface. To this end, we developed a single chain antibody (sc1E3) against hIL-1beta that exhibited the equivalent affinity of the soluble IL-1 receptor type I (sIL-1R) for hIL-1beta and competitively blocked the sIL-1R from binding to the cytokine. The antibody proved to be more specific for hIL-1beta than the sIL-1R in that it failed to bind to either murine IL-1beta or human/murine IL-1alpha proteins. Additionally, failure of sc1E3 to bind to several hIL-1beta mutant proteins, altered at receptor site B, indicated that the antibody interacted preferentially with this site. This, coupled with other surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements, shows that sc1E3 can achieve comparable affinity of binding hIL-1beta as the receptor through interactions at a smaller interface. This stable single chain antibody based heterodimer has simplified the complexity of the IL-1/IL-1R PPI system and will facilitate the design of the low molecular weight inhibitors of this interaction.},

R. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 8075-8079]. The calorimetric enthalpy of association is negative and declines linearly with temperature in the range 10-37 degrees C (delta Cp = -340 +/- 40 cal mol-1 K-1). Entropic contributions calculated using previously determined values of the affinity of association are negative (unfavorable) in this temperature range. This result is consistent with the loss of mobility upon association of the unusually mobile segments of HEL which form the HyHEL-5 epitope. As the affinity of association is approximately constant in this temperature range, an enthalpy-entropy compensation effect is implied. The hydrophobic and vibrational contributions to delta S and delta Cp are estimated using the method of Sturtevant [Sturtevant, J. M. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 2236-2240]. The experimental value of delta Cp is in rather close agreement with the delta Cp estimated from the polar and nonpolar surface areas buried upon association.},

abstract = {Hydrogel membranes have been fabricated that incorporate antibody/antigen moieties. The permeability of large solutes through these membranes is dependent on the presence of soluble antigen that can compete with the internal interactions between antibody and antigen leading to an increase in gel mesh size. Specifically, the membrane's structure is based on a dextran backbone grafted with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antigen and a sheep anti-FITC IgG antibody. The backbone is covalently cross-linked by conjugated divinyl sulfone (DVS) groups. The gel structure is additionally stabilized by affinity crosslinks formed by biospecific interactions between the bound IgG and FITC. FTIR spectra of the gel are consistent with formation of covalent bonds between cysteine groups in the IgG and DVS groups in the dextran. Results obtained using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirmed the competitive interaction binding between IgG-FITC-dextran and free sodium fluorescein at pH 5.0. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of samples prepared using cryofixation and cryofracturing techniques showed that observed changes in permeability correlate with free fluorescein-dependent structural changes in the gel. Three-dimensional images obtained from confocal laser scanning microscopy show that these changes occur throughout the gel and indicate that SEM results are not artifacts of sample preparation. The permeability of these gels, as shown by blue-dextran (12 kDa) diffusion, increases in response to the presence of free fluorescein of the external medium, which causes competitive displacement of the affinity cross-links. Sequential addition and removal of sodium fluorescein showed that these permeability changes are reversible.},

abstract = {The thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between hen egg white lysozyme and Fab D1.3 were determined by measuring the temperature dependence of the ratio of its kinetic association and dissociation rate constants. Biosensor technology (BIAcore 2000) was used to measure the rate constants at temperatures ranging from 5 to 40 degrees C. The value of DeltaG degrees at 25 degrees C (-49 kJ M-1) calculated by this method was very close to that obtained previously from fluorescence quenching measurements (-48.5 kJ M-1). However, the value of DeltaH degrees measured at 25 degrees C by biosensor technology (-35 kJ M-1) was smaller than that determined previously by microcalorimetry (-90 kJ M-1). Another difference was the limited variation of ln K and DeltaG with temperature observed with BIAcore compared to the steady decrease of ln K with temperature found by calorimetry. Our data showed that the binding reaction was driven only by enthalpy below 23 degrees C, by enthalpy and entropy between 23 and 35 degrees C, and only by entropy above 35 degrees C. This suggests, inter alia, that the contribution from the enthalpy of hydration due to the water molecules present at the interface in the lysozyme-antibody complex is progressively eliminated as the temperature increases. Whereas calorimetric data pertain to all the components present in the sample, including solvent molecules, BIAcore measurements monitor only the physical association and dissociation of the two macromolecular species. The difference between the two sets of data may also reflect the complexity of the binding mechanism between lysozyme and Fab D1.3.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of a site-directed mutant of the bacterially expressed Fv fragment from monoclonal antibody D1.3, complexed to the specific antigen lysozyme has been determined to a nominal resolution of 1.8 A using X-ray diffraction data. The replacement of VL Trp92 by Asp allows two water molecules to occupy space taken by Trp92 in the wild-type complex, in agreement with a previous observation that water molecules play an important role in stabilizing this antigen-antibody complex. The equilibrium constant for the binding of the mutant Fv to the antigen decreases by three orders of magnitude (from 2.3 x 10(8) M-1 to 2.6 x 10(5) M-1). Titration calorimetry shows that this results from a smaller negative binding enthalpy (delta delta H = -16 kJ mol-1 at 24 degrees C), whereas the value of the binding entropy is not affected. Since in the complex between the mutated Fv and antigen the buried area has decreased relative to that of the wild-type Fv by about 150 A2, the contribution of the buried unit area to the decrease in free energy (delta Gzero) is approximately 117 J mol-1 (28 cal mol-1) per A2. The loss of interatomic contacts in replacing Trp by Asp permits an approximate calculation for the contribution of van der Waals interactions made by Trp92 in this complex, which gives an average of 2.1 kJ mol-1 (0.5 kcal mol-1) for contacts between carbon atoms.},

abstract = {To study the role of hydrogen bonding via interfacial water molecules in protein-protein interactions, we examined the interaction between hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) and its HyHEL-10 variable domain fragment (Fv) antibody. We constructed three antibody mutants (l-Y50F, l-S91A, and l-S93A) and investigated the interactions between the mutant Fvs and HEL. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that the mutations significantly decreased the negative enthalpy change (8-25 kJ mol(-1)), despite some offset by a favorable entropy change. X-ray crystallography demonstrated that the complexes had nearly identical structures, including the positions of the interfacial water molecules. Taken together, the isothermal titration calorimetric and x-ray crystallographic results indicate that hydrogen bonding via interfacial water enthalpically contributes to the Fv-HEL interaction despite the partial offset because of entropy loss, suggesting that hydrogen bonding stiffens the antigen-antibody complex.},

abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein is conformationally flexible. Upon binding to the host cell receptor CD4, gp120 assumes a conformation that is recognized by the second receptor, CCR5 and/or CXCR4, and by the CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies. Guided by the X-ray crystal structure of a gp120-CD4-CD4i antibody complex, we introduced changes into gp120 that were designed to stabilize or disrupt this conformation. One mutant, 375 S/W, in which the tryptophan indole group is predicted to occupy the Phe 43 cavity in the gp120 interior, apparently favors a gp120 conformation closer to that of the CD4-bound state. The 375 S/W mutant was recognized as well as or better than wild-type gp120 by CD4 and CD4i antibodies, and the large decrease in entropy observed when wild-type gp120 bound CD4 was reduced for the 375 S/W mutant. The recognition of the 375 S/W mutant by CD4BS antibodies, which are directed against the CD4-binding region of gp120, was markedly reduced compared with that of the wild-type gp120. Compared with the wild-type virus, viruses with the 375 S/W envelope glycoproteins were resistant to neutralization by IgG1b12, a CD4BS antibody, were slightly more sensitive to soluble CD4 neutralization and were neutralized more efficiently by the 2G12 antibody. Another mutant, 423 I/P, in which the gp120 bridging sheet was disrupted, did not bind CD4, CCR5, or CD4i antibodies, even though recognition by CD4BS antibodies was efficient. These results indicate that CD4BS antibodies recognize conformations of gp120 different from that recognized by CD4 and CD4i antibodies.},

This mutation decreases the equilibrium association constant of HyHEL-5 for BWQL by over 1000-fold as compared to HEL. The three-dimensional structure of this complex has been obtained recently. Fluorescein-labeled BWQL, obtained by labeling at pH 7.5 and purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatograpy, bound HyHEL-5 with an equilibrium association constant close to that determined for unlabeled BWQL by isothermal titration calorimetry. Fluorescence titration, stopped-flow kinetics, and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments using various concentrations of the osmolytes glycerol, ethylene glycol, and betaine to perturb binding gave a lower limit of the uptake of approximately 6-12 water molecules upon formation of the HyHEL-5/BWQL complex.},

abstract = {The chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS) is reported to bind to the receptors for C5a and formylated peptides and has been proposed as a promising lead for the development of new anti-inflammatory compounds. Here we have examined the receptor specificity and mode of action of recombinant CHIPS(28-149) and also the immune response to CHIPS(28-149) in patients with S. aureus infections and in uninfected controls. Recombinant CHIPS(28-149) bound with high affinity to the human C5a receptor (C5aR), but had low affinity for the second C5a receptor, C5L2, and the formyl peptide receptor, FPR. Although ligand binding to C5aR was potently inhibited, CHIPS(28-149) had much weaker effects on ligand binding to C5L2 and FPR. Similarly, CHIPS(28-149) potently inhibited the ligand-induced activation of C5aR but was less potent at inhibition via FPR. NMR studies showed that CHIPS(28-149) bound directly to the N-terminus of C5aR but not C5L2, and CHIPS(28-149) residues involved in the interaction were identified by chemical shift analysis. All human sera examined contained high titres of IgG and IgA reactivity against CHIPS(28-149), and no correlation was observed between infection status at the time of serum collection and antibody titre. Individual serum samples promoted or inhibited the binding of CHIPS(28-149) to C5aR, or had no effect. IgG depletion of serum samples abrogated the effects on CHIPS binding, demonstrating that these were antibody mediated. Sera from infected individuals were more likely to inhibit CHIPS(28-149) binding than sera from healthy controls. However, high antibody titres correlated well with both inhibition and enhancement of CHIPS(28-149) binding to C5aR; this suggests that the inhibitory effect relates to epitope specificity rather than greater antibody binding. We conclude that CHIPS is likely to be too immunogenic to be used as an anti-inflammatory treatment but that some antibodies against CHIPS may be useful in the treatment of S. aureus infections.},

abstract = {The binding of murine monoclonal antibody HyHEL-5 to lysozyme has been the subject of extensive crystallographic, computational, and experimental investigations. The complex of HyHEL-5 with hen egg lysozyme (HEL) features salt bridges between Fab heavy chain residue Glu(50), and Arg(45) and Arg(68) of HEL. This interaction has been predicted to play a dominant role in the association on the basis of molecular electrostatics calculations. The association of aspartic acid and glutamine mutants at position 50(H) of the cloned HyHEL-5 Fab with HEL and bobwhite quail lysozyme (BQL), an avian variant bearing an Arg(68) --> Lys substitution in the epitope, was characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry and sedimentation equilibrium. Affinities for HEL were reduced by 400-fold (E50(H)D) and 40,000-fold (E50(H)Q) (DeltaDeltaG degrees estimated at 4.0 and 6.4 kcal mol(-1), respectively). The same mutations reduce affinity for BQL by only 7- and 55-fold, respectively, indicating a reduced specificity for HEL. The loss of affinity upon mutation is in each case primarily due to an unfavorable change in the enthalpy of the interaction; the entropic contribution is virtually unchanged. An enthalpy-entropy compensation exists for each interaction; DeltaH degrees decreases, while DeltaS degrees increases with temperature. The DeltaCp for each mutant interaction is less negative than the wild-type. Mutant-cycle analysis suggests the mutations present in the HyHEL-5 Fab mutants are linked to those present in the BQL with coupling energies between 3 and 4 kcal mol(-1).},

abstract = {The mechanism of recognition of proteins and peptides by antibodies and the factors determining binding affinity and specificity are mediated by essentially the same features. However, additional effects of the usually unfolded and flexible solution structure of peptide ligands have to be considered. In an earlier study we designed and optimized six peptides (pepI to pepVI) mimicking the discontinuous binding site of interleukin-10 for the anti-interleukin-10 monoclonal antibody (mab) CB/RS/1. Three of them were selected for analysis of their solution conformation by circular dichroism measurements. The peptides differ in the content of alpha-helices and in the inducibility of helical secondary structures by trifluoroethanol. These properties, however, do not correlate with the binding affinity. PepVI, a 32-mer cyclic epitope mimic, has the highest affinity to mab CB/RS/1 identified to date. CD difference spectroscopy suggests an increase of the alpha-helix content of pepVI with complex formation. Binding of pepVI to mab CB/RS/1 is characterized by a large negative, favorable binding enthalpy and a smaller unfavorable loss of entropy (DeltaH degrees = -16.4 kcal x mol(-1), TDeltaS degrees = -6.9 kcal x mol(-1)) resulting in DeltaG degrees = -9.5 kcal x mol(-1) at 25 degrees C as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Binding of pepVI is enthalpically driven over the entire temperature range studied (10-35 degrees C). Complex formation is not accompanied by proton uptake or release. A negative heat capacity change DeltaC(p) of -0.354 kcal x mol(-1) x K(-1) was determined from the temperature dependence of DeltaH degrees. The selection of protein mimics with the observed thermodynamic properties is promoted by the applied identification and iterative optimization procedure.},

abstract = {Single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments of antibodies have become important analytical and therapeutic tools in biology and medicine. The reaction of scFv fragments has not been well-characterized with respect to the energetics and kinetics of antigen binding. This paper describes the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of the high-affinity scFv fragment SW1 directed against the dimeric leucine zipper domain of the yeast transcription factor GCN4. The scFv fragment was selected by the phage display technique from the immune repertoire of a mouse that had been immunized with the leucine zipper domain of GCN4. The scFv fragment was produced in high yield in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies and refolded from the denatured state. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that SW1 was stable up to about 50 degreesC, but the subsequent thermal denaturation was irreversible (Tm approximately 68 degreesC). The scFv fragment specifically recognized the dimeric leucine zipper conformation. Two scFv fragments bound to the GCN4 dimer to form the complex (scFv)2-GCN4. Because of its repetitive structure, the rod-shaped GCN4 leucine zipper may present two similar epitopes for the scFv fragment. Surprisingly, the binding reaction was highly cooperative, that is, the species (scFv)2-GCN4 dominated over scFv-GCN4 even in the presence of a large excess of the antigen GCN4. It is speculated that cooperativity resulted from direct interaction between the two GCN4-bound scFv fragments. At 25 degreesC, the average binding enthalpy for a scFv fragment was favorable (-61 kJ mol-1), the entropy change was unfavorable, and the change in heat capacity was -1.27 +/- 0.14 kJ mol-1 K-1. As a result of enthalpy-entropy compensation, the free binding energy was virtually independent of temperature in the physiological temperature range. Antigen binding in solution could be described by a single-exponential reaction with an apparent rate constant of 1 x 10(6) M-1 s-1. Binding followed in a biosensor with the dimeric GCN4 coupled to the surface of the metal oxide sensor chip was 20 times slower.},

abstract = {The CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions) and CASP (Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) experiments have demonstrated the power of community-wide tests of methodology in assessing the current state of the art and spurring progress in the very challenging areas of protein docking and structure prediction. We sought to bring the power of community-wide experiments to bear on a very challenging protein design problem that provides a complementary but equally fundamental test of current understanding of protein-binding thermodynamics. We have generated a number of designed protein-protein interfaces with very favorable computed binding energies but which do not appear to be formed in experiments, suggesting that there may be important physical chemistry missing in the energy calculations. A total of 28 research groups took up the challenge of determining what is missing: we provided structures of 87 designed complexes and 120 naturally occurring complexes and asked participants to identify energetic contributions and/or structural features that distinguish between the two sets. The community found that electrostatics and solvation terms partially distinguish the designs from the natural complexes, largely due to the nonpolar character of the designed interactions. Beyond this polarity difference, the community found that the designed binding surfaces were, on average, structurally less embedded in the designed monomers, suggesting that backbone conformational rigidity at the designed surface is important for realization of the designed function. These results can be used to improve computational design strategies, but there is still much to be learned; for example, one designed complex, which does form in experiments, was classified by all metrics as a nonbinder.},

abstract = {The Lewis X trisaccharide is pivotal in mediating specific cell-cell interactions. Monoclonal antibody 291-2G3-A, which was generated from mice infected with schistosomes, has been shown to recognize the Lewis X trisaccharide. Here we describe the structure of the Fab fragment of 291-2G3-A, with Lewis X, to 1.8 A resolution. The crystallographic analysis revealed that the antigen binding site is a rather shallow binding pocket, and residues from all six complementary determining regions of the antibody contact all sugar residues. The high specificity of the binding pocket does not result in high affinity; the K(D) determined by isothermal calorimetry is 11 microM. However, this affinity is in the same range as for other sugar-antibody complexes. The detailed understanding of the antibody-Lewis X interaction revealed by the crystal structure may be helpful in the design of better diagnostic tools for schistosomiasis and for studying Lewis X-mediated cell-cell interactions by antibody interference.},

abstract = {Peptide mimetics may substitute for carbohydrate antigens in vaccine design applications. At present, the structural and immunological aspects of antigenic mimicry, which translate into immunologic mimicry, as well as the functional correlates of each, are unknown. In contrast to screening peptide display libraries, we demonstrate the feasibility of a structure-assisted vaccine design approach to identify functional mimeotopes. By using concanavalin A (ConA), as a recognition template, peptide mimetics reactive with ConA were identified. Designed peptides were observed to compete with synthetic carbohydrate probes for ConA binding, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis. ITC measurements indicate that a multivalent form of one particular mimetic binds to ConA with similar affinity as does trimannoside. Splenocytes from mimeotope-immunized mice display a peptide-specific cellular response, confirming a T-cell-dependent nature for the mimetic. As ConA binds to the Envelope protein of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), we observed that mimeotope-induced serum also binds to HIV-1-infected cells, as assessed by flow cytometry, and could neutralize T-cell line adapted HIV-1 isolates in vitro, albeit at low titers. These studies emphasize that mimicry is based more upon functional rather than structural determinants that regulate mimeotope-induced T-dependent antibody responses to polysaccharide and emphasize that rational approaches can be employed to develop further vaccine candidates.},

abstract = {The Fv fragment of the 0.5beta monoclonal antibody has recently been constructed, expressed, and purified. It binds with nanomolar affinity to the immunogenic RP135 peptide that is derived from the principal neutralizing determinant of HIV-1 in the third hypervariable region of gp120. Here, we analyzed the temperature-dependence of binding of the 0.5beta Fv fragment to the RP135 peptide and a series of mutants thereof. Our results show that there is almost complete enthalpy-entropy compensation in the effects of mutations in the peptide on binding to the Fv, indicating that the mutations do not change the binding mechanism. There is good correlation, for residues within the antigenic epitope, between mutational effects on DeltaCp and calculated values of DeltaDeltaCp based on the extent of burial of polar and non-polar surface areas of amino acids. The value of DeltaCp for the binding of the 0.5beta Fv fragment to the wild-type RP135 peptide is found to be -5.0 (+/- 0.9) kcal K-1 mol-1 in the presence of 0.1% Tween-20 but only -0.1 (+/- 0.9) kcal K-1 mol-1 in its absence. This result has important implications for the successful application of the structural parameterization approach to predicting changes in heat capacity that accompany binding reactions carried out in the presence of detergent or protein-stabilizing agents.},

TRIM proteins have conserved domain architecture but diverse cellular roles. Here, we describe how the C-terminal PRYSPRY domain mediates diverse TRIM functions. The crystal structure of TRIM21 PRYSPRY in complex with its target IgG Fc reveals a canonical binding interface comprised of two discrete pockets formed by antibody-like variable loops. Alanine scanning of this interface has identified the hot-spot residues that control TRIM21 binding to Fc; the same hot-spots control HIV/murine leukemia virus restriction by TRIM5alpha and mediate severe familial Mediterranean fever in TRIM20/pyrin. Characterization of the IgG binding site for TRIM21 PRYSPRY reveals TRIM21 as a superantigen analogous to bacterial protein A and suggests that an antibody bipolar bridging mechanism may contribute to the pathogenic accumulation of anti-TRIM21 autoantibody immune complex in autoimmune disease.},

The binding constants K(A) at 25 degrees C vary between 5.1 x 10(7) M (-1) for the strongest and 1.4 x 10(5) M (-1) for the weakest binder. For each of the peptides complex formation is enthalpically driven and connected with unfavorable entropic contributions; however, the ratio of enthalpy and entropy contributions to deltaG(0) differs markedly for the individual peptides. A plot of -deltaH(0) vs -TdeltaS(0) shows a linear correlation of the data for a wide variety of experimental conditions as expected for a process with deltaC(p) much larger than deltaS(0). The dissimilarity of deltaC(p) and deltaS(0) also explains why deltaH(0) and TdeltaS(0) show similar temperature dependences resulting in relatively small changes of deltaG(0) with temperature. The heat capacity changes deltaC(p) upon antibody-peptide complex formation determined for three selected peptides vary only in a small range, indicating basic thermodynamic similarity despite different key residues interacting in the complexes. Furthermore, the comparison of van't Hoff and calorimetric enthalpies point to a non-two-state binding mechanism. Protonation effects were excluded by measurements in buffers of different ionization enthalpies. Differences in the solution conformation of the peptides as demonstrated by circular dichroic measurements do not explain different binding affinities of the peptides; specifically a high helix content in solution is not essential for high binding affinity despite the helical epitope conformation in the crystal structure of p24.},

They are limited by the availability of naturally occurring ligands with appropriate target specificity. Here we describe a biosensor based on an engineered fibronectin monobody scaffold that can be tailored to bind different targets via high-throughput screening. We made this Src-family kinase (SFK) biosensor by derivatizing a monobody specific for activated SFKs with a bright dye whose fluorescence increases upon target binding. We identified sites for dye attachment and changes to eliminate vesiculation in living cells, providing a generalizable scaffold for biosensor production. This approach minimizes cell perturbation because it senses endogenous, unmodified target, and because sensitivity is enhanced by direct dye excitation. Automated correlation of cell velocities and SFK activity revealed that SFKs are activated specifically during protrusion. Activity correlates with velocity, and peaks 1-2 $\mu$m from the leading edge.},

Environment and residue pair specific contributions to the scoring functions appear as the first two terms in a series expansion for the residue probability distributions in the protein database; the decoupling of the distance and environment dependencies of the distributions resolves the major problems with current database-derived scoring functions noted by Thomas and Dill. The simulated annealing procedure rapidly and frequently generates native-like structures for small helical proteins and better than random structures for small beta sheet containing proteins. Most of the simulated structures have native-like solvent accessibility and secondary structure patterns, and thus ensembles of these structures provide a particularly challenging set of decoys for evaluating scoring functions. We investigate the effects of multiple sequence information and different types of conformational constraints on the overall performance of the method, and the ability of a variety of recently developed scoring functions to recognize the native-like conformations in the ensembles of simulated structures.},

In the absence of the viral Vif protein hA3G is packaged into virions and during reverse transcription in a recipient cell it deaminates cytosines, leading to G-->A hypermutation and inactivation of the viral DNA. Unlike humans, who carry seven APOBEC3 genes, mice only carry one, mA3. Thus the role of mA3 in restriction of retroviral infection could be studied in mA3 -/- knockout mice, where the gene is inactivated. M-MuLV-infected mA3 -/- mice showed substantially higher levels of infection at very early times compared to wild-type mice (ca. 2 logs at 0-10 days), particularly in the bone marrow and spleen. Restriction of M-MuLV infection was studied ex vivo in primary bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) that express or lack mA3, using an M-MuLV-based retroviral vector expressing enhanced jellyfish green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The results indicated that mA3 within the virions as well as mA3 in the recipient cell contribute to resistance to infection in BMDCs. Finally, M-MuLV-infected mA3 +/+ mice developed leukemia more slowly compared to animals lacking one or both copies of mA3 although the resulting disease was similar (T-lymphoma). These studies indicate that mA3 restricts replication and pathogenesis of M-MuLV in vivo.},

Although previous methodologies to produce hmAbs, including B-cell immortalization or phage display, can be used to isolate the rare specific antibody even years after immunization, in comparison, these approaches are inefficient, resulting in few relevant antibodies.

abstract = {The mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex ecosystem consisting of countless bacteria in homeostasis with the host immune system. Shaped by evolution, this partnership has potential for symbiotic benefit. However, the identities of bacterial molecules mediating symbiosis remain undefined. Here we show that, during colonization of animals with the ubiquitous gut microorganism Bacteroides fragilis, a bacterial polysaccharide (PSA) directs the cellular and physical maturation of the developing immune system. Comparison with germ-free animals reveals that the immunomodulatory activities of PSA during B. fragilis colonization include correcting systemic T cell deficiencies and T(H)1/T(H)2 imbalances and directing lymphoid organogenesis. A PSA mutant of B. fragilis does not restore these immunologic functions. PSA presented by intestinal dendritic cells activates CD4+ T cells and elicits appropriate cytokine production. These findings provide a molecular basis for host-bacterial symbiosis and reveal the archetypal molecule of commensal bacteria that mediates development of the host immune system.},

abstract = {The remarkable infectivity and virulence of the 1918 influenza virus resulted in an unprecedented pandemic, raising the question of whether it is possible to develop protective immunity to this virus and whether immune evasion may have contributed to its spread. Here, we report that the highly lethal 1918 virus is susceptible to immune protection by a preventive vaccine, and we define its mechanism of action. Immunization with plasmid expression vectors encoding hemagglutinin (HA) elicited potent CD4 and CD8 cellular responses as well as neutralizing antibodies. Antibody specificity and titer were defined by a microneutralization and a pseudotype assay that could assess antibody specificity without the need for high-level biocontainment. This pseudotype inhibition assay can define evolving serotypes of influenza viruses and facilitate the development of immune sera and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that may help contain pandemic influenza. Notably, mice vaccinated with 1918 HA plasmid DNAs showed complete protection to lethal challenge. T cell depletion had no effect on immunity, but passive transfer of purified IgG from anti-H1(1918) immunized mice provided protective immunity for na{\"\i}ve mice challenged with infectious 1918 virus. Thus, humoral immunity directed at the viral HA can protect against the 1918 pandemic virus.},

abstract = {During ubiquitin conjugation, the thioester bond that links "donor" ubiquitin to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) undergoes nucleophilic attack by the ɛ-amino group of an acceptor lysine, resulting in formation of an isopeptide bond. Models of ubiquitination have envisioned the donor ubiquitin to be a passive participant in this process. However, we show here that the I44A mutation in ubiquitin profoundly inhibits its ability to serve as a donor for ubiquitin chain initiation or elongation, but can be rescued by computationally predicted compensatory mutations in the E2 Cdc34. The donor defect of ubiquitin-I44A can be partially suppressed either by using a low pKa amine (hydroxylamine) as the acceptor or by performing reactions at higher pH, suggesting that the discharge defect arises in part due to inefficient deprotonation of the acceptor lysine. We propose that interaction between Cdc34 and the donor ubiquitin organizes the active site to promote efficient ubiquitination of substrate.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, reduced numbers of peripheral blood isotype-switched memory B cells, and loss of plasma cells. OBJECTIVE: Because Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation of B cells can initiate and potentially sustain normal B cell functions, we examined functional outcomes of TLR7 and TLR9 signaling in CVID B cells. METHODS: TLR7-mediated, TLR7/8-mediated, and TLR9-mediated cell proliferation, isotype switch, and immunoglobulin production by control and CVID B cells or isolated naive and memory B cell subsets were examined. We quantitated TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-12 production in response to TLR1-9 ligands and measured IFN-alpha production by TLR7-stimulated PBMCs and isolated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). IFN-beta mRNA expression by TLR3-stimulated fibroblasts was assessed. RESULTS: Unlike CD27(+) B cells of controls, TLR7-activated, TLR7/8-activated, or TLR9-activated CVID B cells or isolated CD27(+) B cells did not proliferate, upregulate CD27, or shed surface IgD. TLR-stimulated CVID B cells failed to upregulate activation-induced cytosine deaminase mRNA or produce IgG and IgA. TLR7-stimulated PBMCs and pDCs produced little or no IFN-alpha. Reconstituting IFN-alpha in TLR7-stimulated CVID B-cell cultures facilitated proliferation, CD27 upregulation, and isotype switch. These TLR defects are restricted because CVID PBMCs stimulated with TLR ligands produced normal amounts of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-12; TLR3-mediated expression of IFN-beta by CVID fibroblasts was normal. CONCLUSION: Defective TLR7 and TLR9 signaling in CVID B cells and pDCs, coupled with deficient IFN-alpha, impairs CVID B cell functions and prevents TLR-mediated augmentation of humoral immunity in vivo.},

abstract = {Pre-existing neutralizing antibody provides the first line of defence against pathogens in general. For influenza virus, annual vaccinations are given to maintain protective levels of antibody against the currently circulating strains. Here we report that after booster vaccination there was a rapid and robust influenza-specific IgG+ antibody-secreting plasma cell (ASC) response that peaked at approximately day 7 and accounted for up to 6% of peripheral blood B cells. These ASCs could be distinguished from influenza-specific IgG+ memory B cells that peaked 14-21 days after vaccination and averaged 1% of all B cells. Importantly, as much as 80% of ASCs purified at the peak of the response were influenza specific. This ASC response was characterized by a highly restricted B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire that in some donors was dominated by only a few B-cell clones. This pauci-clonal response, however, showed extensive intraclonal diversification from accumulated somatic mutations. We used the immunoglobulin variable regions isolated from sorted single ASCs to produce over 50 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bound to the three influenza vaccine strains with high affinity. This strategy demonstrates that we can generate multiple high-affinity mAbs from humans within a month after vaccination. The panel of influenza-virus-specific human mAbs allowed us to address the issue of original antigenic sin (OAS): the phenomenon where the induced antibody shows higher affinity to a previously encountered influenza virus strain compared with the virus strain present in the vaccine. However, we found that most of the influenza-virus-specific mAbs showed the highest affinity for the current vaccine strain. Thus, OAS does not seem to be a common occurrence in normal, healthy adults receiving influenza vaccination.},

However, it remains very challenging to account for backbone conformational changes during docking, and most current methods inherently keep monomer backbones rigid for algorithmic simplicity and computational efficiency. Here we present a reformulation of the Rosetta docking method that incorporates explicit backbone flexibility in protein-protein docking. The new method is based on a "fold-tree" representation of the molecular system, which seamlessly integrates internal torsional degrees of freedom and rigid-body degrees of freedom. Problems with internal flexible regions ranging from one or more loops or hinge regions to all of one or both partners can be readily treated using appropriately constructed fold trees. The explicit treatment of backbone flexibility improves both sampling in the vicinity of the native docked conformation and the energetic discrimination between near-native and incorrect models.},

abstract = {A major limitation of current comparative modeling methods is the accuracy with which regions that are structurally divergent from homologues of known structure can be modeled. Because structural differences between homologous proteins are responsible for variations in protein function and specificity, the ability to model these differences has important functional consequences. Although existing methods can provide reasonably accurate models of short loop regions, modeling longer structurally divergent regions is an unsolved problem. Here we describe a method based on the de novo structure prediction algorithm, Rosetta, for predicting conformations of structurally divergent regions in comparative models. Initial conformations for short segments are selected from the protein structure database, whereas longer segments are built up by using three- and nine-residue fragments drawn from the database and combined by using the Rosetta algorithm. A gap closure term in the potential in combination with modified Newton's method for gradient descent minimization is used to ensure continuity of the peptide backbone. Conformations of variable regions are refined in the context of a fixed template structure using Monte Carlo minimization together with rapid repacking of side-chains to iteratively optimize backbone torsion angles and side-chain rotamers. For short loops, mean accuracies of 0.69, 1.45, and 3.62 A are obtained for 4, 8, and 12 residue loops, respectively. In addition, the method can provide reasonable models of conformations of longer protein segments: predicted conformations of 3A root-mean-square deviation or better were obtained for 5 of 10 examples of segments ranging from 13 to 34 residues. In combination with a sequence alignment algorithm, this method generates complete, ungapped models of protein structures, including regions both similar to and divergent from a homologous structure. This combined method was used to make predictions for 28 protein domains in the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure 4 (CASP 4) and 59 domains in CASP 5, where the method ranked highly among comparative modeling and fold recognition methods. Model accuracy in these blind predictions is dominated by alignment quality, but in the context of accurate alignments, long protein segments can be accurately modeled. Notably, the method correctly predicted the local structure of a 39-residue insertion into a TIM barrel in CASP 5 target T0186.},

abstract = {Protein residues that are critical for structure and function are expected to be conserved throughout evolution. Here, we investigate the extent to which these conserved residues are clustered in three-dimensional protein structures. In 92% of the proteins in a data set of 79 proteins, the most conserved positions in multiple sequence alignments are significantly more clustered than randomly selected sets of positions. The comparison to random subsets is not necessarily appropriate, however, because the signal could be the result of differences in the amino acid composition of sets of conserved residues compared to random subsets (hydrophobic residues tend to be close together in the protein core), or differences in sequence separation of the residues in the different sets. In order to overcome these limits, we compare the degree of clustering of the conserved positions on the native structure and on alternative conformations generated by the de novo structure prediction method Rosetta. For 65% of the 79 proteins, the conserved residues are significantly more clustered in the native structure than in the alternative conformations, indicating that the clustering of conserved residues in protein structures goes beyond that expected purely from sequence locality and composition effects. The differences in the spatial distribution of conserved residues can be utilized in de novo protein structure prediction: We find that for 79% of the proteins, selection of the Rosetta generated conformations with the greatest clustering of the conserved residues significantly enriches the fraction of close-to-native structures.},

Thus, the idea of feeding them, hierarchically, into a more accurate method that samples less effectively was introduced a decade ago but has not met with more than limited success in a few isolated instances. Ideally, the final stages should be able to identify the native state, show a good correlation with native similarity in order to add value to the selection process, and refine the structures even further. In this work, we explore the possibility of using state-of-the-art explicit solvent molecular dynamics and implicit solvent free energy calculations to accomplish all three of those objectives on 12 small, single-domain proteins, four each of alpha, beta and mixed topologies. We find that this approach is very successful in ranking the native and also enhances the structure selection of predictions generated from the Rosetta method.},

abstract = {The binding of neutralizing antibodies 2F5 and 4E10 to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 involves both the viral membrane and gp41 membrane proximal external region (MPER) epitopes. In this study, we have used several biophysical tools to examine the secondary structure, orientation, and depth of immersion of gp41 MPER peptides in liposomes and to determine how the orientation of the MPER with lipids affects the binding kinetics of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 2F5 and 4E10. The binding of 2F5 and 4E10 both to their respective nominal epitopes and to a biepitope (includes 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes) MPER peptide-liposome conjugate was best described by a two-step encounter-docking model. Analysis of the binding kinetics and the effect of temperature on the binding stability of 2F5 and 4E10 to MPER peptide-liposome conjugates revealed that the docking of 4E10 was relatively slower and thermodynamically less favorable. The results of fluorescence-quenching and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments showed that the 2F5 epitope was more solvent exposed, whereas the 4E10 epitope was immersed in the polar-apolar interfacial region of the lipid bilayer. A circular dichroism spectroscopic study demonstrated that the nominal epitope and biepitope MPER peptides adopted ordered structures with differing helical contents when anchored to liposomes. Furthermore, anchoring of MPER peptides to the membrane via a hydrophobic anchor sequence was required for efficient MAb docking. These results support the model that the ability of 2F5 and 4E10 to bind to membrane lipid is required for stable docking to membrane-embedded MPER residues. These data have important implications for the design and use of peptide-liposome conjugates as immunogens for the induction of MPER-neutralizing antibodies.},

abstract = {The acquired-immunodeficiency syndrome has evolved into a major worldwide epidemic. Significant effort has been made in the development of antiviral therapies. A new strategy for vaccine and drug design that complements the existing cocktail therapy is to target entry of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Such an approach provides the advantage of interfering with multiple intermediates in this multi-step process. The extraordinary conformational flexibility, glycosylation, and strain variations of viral glycoprotein gp120 cause general viral evasion of humoral immune response and thus complicate the development of an effective vaccine. Especially difficult to define are the conformation of gp120 before CD4 engagement as well as the relative orientations of the V1/V2 and V3 loops with respect to the inner and outer domains. In this study, we used Floppy Inclusion and Rigid Substructure Topography (FIRST), a program based on graph theory, to analyze the flexibility and rigidity of all known HIV-1 gp120 structures. A flexibility index is used to describe and compare the spatial distribution of protein flexibility and rigidity of these structures in isolation and in complex with CD4, CD4-mimics, and neutralizing antibodies. Using this flexibility analysis, we identified a universal rigid region (the alpha2 helix) as well as the consensus largest rigid cluster involving a beta-sheet located on the coreceptor binding face. Both of these regions may serve as stable targets for vaccine design and drug discovery. Detailed comparisons of the changes in flexibility based on strain variations, stabilizing mutations, binding features of CD4 mimics, and impact of b12 binding are reported.},

abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 exterior gp120 envelope glycoprotein is highly flexible, and this flexibility may contribute to the inability of monomeric gp120 immunogens to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. We previously showed that an S375W modification of a critical interfacial cavity central to the primary receptor binding site, the Phe43 cavity, stabilizes gp120 into the CD4-bound state. However, the immunological effects of this cavity-altering replacement were never tested. Subsequently, we screened other mutations that, along with the S375W alteration, might further stabilize the CD4-bound state. Here, we define a selected second cavity-altering replacement, T257S, and analyze the double mutations in several gp120 envelope glycoprotein contexts. The gp120 glycoproteins with the T257S-plus-S375W double mutation (T257S+S375W) have a superior antigenic profile compared to the originally identified single S375W replacement in terms of enhanced recognition by the broadly neutralizing CD4 binding-site antibody b12. Isothermal titration calorimetry measuring the entropy of the gp120 interaction with CD4 indicated that the double mutant was also stabilized into the CD4-bound state, with increasing relative fixation between core, full-length monomeric, and full-length trimeric versions of gp120. A significant increase in gp120 affinity for CD4 was also observed for the cavity-filling mutants relative to wild-type gp120. The most conformationally constrained T257S+S375W trimeric gp120 proteins were selected for immunogenicity analysis in rabbits and displayed a trend of improvement relative to their wild-type counterparts in terms of eliciting neutralizing antibodies. Together, the results suggest that conformational stabilization may improve the ability of gp120 to elicit neutralizing antibodies.},

The Hartree-Fock energy of each conformer was determined at the MINI level with GAMESS. The conformational entropy was determined per conformer and per residue from the mass-weighted covariance matrices. The Shannon entropy per residue was determined from sequence-substitution frequencies. Correlations were determined by linear regression analysis. There was a negative correlation between the Hartree-Fock energy and the conformational entropy (R=-0.4840, p=0.0078, df =28) that enhanced the negative Helmholtz-free-energy change for the binding of the GP120 ligand to target CD4. The Shannon entropy of V3 was a function of the conformational entropy variance (R=0.7225, p=0.00157, df=15) and of the V3 Hartree-Fock energy. Biological implications of this work are that (1) conformational entropy interacts with V3 Hartree-Fock energy to enhance GP120 binding to CD4 cell receptors and that (2) the Hartree-Fock energy of V3 interacts with the evolutionary system to participate in the regulation of V3 diversity.},

abstract = {HIV pseudovirion or virus-like particle vaccines represent a promising approach for eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses. Pseudovirions present the envelope glycoprotein complex in its authentic trimeric form, and thus have the potential to generate neutralizing antibodies against relevant virion-associated epitopes that may be lacking in protein subunit vaccines. The development of pseudovirion particles as a viable vaccine approach for progression to clinical testing has been limited by a number of factors, including shedding of particle-associated gp120, practical limitations to large-scale production and purification, and the generation of antibodies against cellular proteins incorporated on the particle surface that confound the analysis of HIV-specific neutralizing antibody responses. Here, we review methods that address each of these challenges, with a focus on production methods for generating non-infectious Gag-Env pseudovirions. Mammalian cell lines that inducibly express HIV Gag and Env can overcome production limitations, and produce pseudovirions that retain gp120 following purification. Baculovirus production systems have the potential to provide higher quantities of particles, but cleavage of gp160 remains a current limitation. Anti-cellular antibody responses can be diminished by adsorption with cell lysates or whole cells. These technical advances should facilitate the further development of pseudovirion vaccine approaches in preclinical testing and future clinical trials.},

abstract = {Live-vector-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines are an integral part of a number of HIV vaccine regimens currently under evaluation. Live vectors that carry an intact gag gene are capable of eliciting HIV pseudovirion particle formation from infected host cells. The impact of pseudovirion particle formation on the immune response generated by live HIV vaccine vectors has not been established. In this study, a canarypox HIV vaccine candidate vector expressing HIV gag and env genes, vCP205, was modified by the introduction of a glycine-to-alanine coding change in the N-terminal myristylation site of gag to create Myr- vCP205. This substitution effectively eliminated particle formation without altering the level of protein production. vCP205 and Myr- vCP205 were then directly compared for the ability to induce HIV-specific immune responses in mice. The particle-competent vector vCP205 elicited higher levels of CD8+ T-cell responses, as indicated by gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and intracellular cytokine staining. Humoral responses to Gag and Env were also markedly higher from animals immunized with the particle-competent vector. Furthermore, HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were greater among animals immunized with the particle-competent vector. Using a human dendritic cell model of antigen presentation in vitro, vCP205 generated greater ELISPOT responses than Myr- vCP205. These results demonstrate that pseudovirion particle production by live-vector HIV vaccines enhances HIV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses.},

The V3 sequence determines whether the virus will manifest R5 or X4 phenotypes and use the CCR5 or CXCR4 chemokine coreceptor, respectively. Previous NMR studies revealed that both R5- and X4-V3 peptides bound to antibodies 0.5beta and 447-52D form beta-hairpin conformations with the GPGR segment at the turn. In contrast, in their free form, linear V3 peptides and a cyclic peptide consisting of the entire 35-residue V3 loop were highly unstructured in aqueous solution. Herein we evaluated a series of synthetic disulfide constrained V3-peptides in which the position of the disulfide bonds, and therefore the ring size, was systematically varied. NMR structures determined for singly and doubly disulfide constrained V3-peptides in aqueous solution were compared with those found for unconstrained V3(JRFL) and V3(IIIB) peptides bound to 447-52D and to 0.5beta, respectively. Our study indicated that cyclic V3 peptides manifested significantly reduced conformational space compared to their linear homologues and that in all cases cyclic peptides exhibited cross-strand interactions suggestive of beta-hairpin-like structures. Nevertheless, the singly constrained V3-peptides retained significant flexibility and did not form an idealized beta-hairpin. Incorporation of a second disulfide bond results in significant overall rigidity, and in one case, a structure close to that of V3(MN) peptide bound to 447-52D Fab was assumed and in another case a structure close to that formed by the linear V3(IIIB) peptide bound to antibody 0.5beta was assumed.},

Env is a heterodimer of a transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) and a surface glycoprotein (gp120), and forms trimers on the surface of the viral membrane. Using cryo-electron tomography combined with three-dimensional image classification and averaging, we report the three-dimensional structures of trimeric Env displayed on native HIV-1 in the unliganded state, in complex with the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 and in a ternary complex with CD4 and the 17b antibody. By fitting the known crystal structures of the monomeric gp120 core in the b12- and CD4/17b-bound conformations into the density maps derived by electron tomography, we derive molecular models for the native HIV-1 gp120 trimer in unliganded and CD4-bound states. We demonstrate that CD4 binding results in a major reorganization of the Env trimer, causing an outward rotation and displacement of each gp120 monomer. This appears to be coupled with a rearrangement of the gp41 region along the central axis of the trimer, leading to closer contact between the viral and target cell membranes. Our findings elucidate the structure and conformational changes of trimeric HIV-1 gp120 relevant to antibody neutralization and attachment to target cells.},

The structure of HIV gp120 bound with receptor (CD4) has been known for some time. We have now determined the structure of a fully glycosylated SIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein in an unliganded conformation by X-ray crystallography at 4.0 A resolution. We describe here our experimental and computational approaches, which may be relevant to other resolution-limited crystallographic problems. Key issues were attention to details of beam geometry mandated by small, weakly diffracting crystals, and choice of strategies for phase improvement, starting with two isomorphous derivatives and including multicrystal averaging. We validated the structure by analyzing composite omit maps, averaged among three distinct crystal lattices, and by calculating model-based, SeMet anomalous difference maps. There are at least four ordered sugars on many of the thirteen oligosaccharides.},

Structures of fragments of gp120 and gp41 from the envelope protein are known, in conformations corresponding to their post-attachment and postfusion states, respectively. We report the crystal structure, at 4 A resolution, of a fully glycosylated SIV gp120 core, in a conformation representing its prefusion state, before interaction with CD4. Parts of the protein have a markedly different organization than they do in the CD4-bound state. Comparison of the unliganded and CD4-bound structures leads to a model for events that accompany receptor engagement of an envelope glycoprotein trimer. The two conformations of gp120 also present distinct antigenic surfaces. We identify the binding site for a compound that inhibits viral entry.},

abstract = {In protein structure prediction, it is often the case that a protein segment must be adjusted to connect two fixed segments. This occurs during loop structure prediction in homology modeling as well as in ab initio structure prediction. Several algorithms for this purpose are based on the inverse Jacobian of the distance constraints with respect to dihedral angle degrees of freedom. These algorithms are sometimes unstable and fail to converge. We present an algorithm developed originally for inverse kinematics applications in robotics. In robotics, an end effector in the form of a robot hand must reach for an object in space by altering adjustable joint angles and arm lengths. In loop prediction, dihedral angles must be adjusted to move the C-terminal residue of a segment to superimpose on a fixed anchor residue in the protein structure. The algorithm, referred to as cyclic coordinate descent or CCD, involves adjusting one dihedral angle at a time to minimize the sum of the squared distances between three backbone atoms of the moving C-terminal anchor and the corresponding atoms in the fixed C-terminal anchor. The result is an equation in one variable for the proposed change in each dihedral. The algorithm proceeds iteratively through all of the adjustable dihedral angles from the N-terminal to the C-terminal end of the loop. CCD is suitable as a component of loop prediction methods that generate large numbers of trial structures. It succeeds in closing loops in a large test set 99.79% of the time, and fails occasionally only for short, highly extended loops. It is very fast, closing loops of length 8 in 0.037 sec on average.},

abstract = {Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is the essential enzyme inducing the DNA cleavage required for both somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (CSR) of the immunoglobulin gene. We originally proposed the RNA-editing model for the mechanism of DNA cleavage by AID. We obtained evidence that fulfils three requirements for CSR by this model, namely (i) AID shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm, (ii) de novo protein synthesis for CSR, and (iii) AID-RNA complex formation. The alternative hypothesis, designated as the DNA-deamination model, assumes that the in vitro DNA deamination activity of AID is representative of its physiological function in vivo. Furthermore, the resulting dU was removed by uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) to generate a basic site, followed by phosphodiester bond cleavage by AP endonuclease. We critically examined each of these provisional steps. We identified a cluster of mutants (H48A, L49A, R50A and N51A) that had particularly higher CSR activities than expected from their DNA deamination activities. The most striking was the N51A mutant that had no ability to deaminate DNA in vitro but retained approximately 50 per cent of the wild-type level of CSR activity. We also provide further evidence that UNG plays a non-canonical role in CSR, namely in the repair step of the DNA breaks. Taking these results together, we favour the RNA-editing model for the function of AID in CSR.},

abstract = {B-cell memory has been extensively analyzed in the systemic immune response elicited by hapten-carrier antigens, and the regulatory mechanisms underlying the process are beginning to be elucidated. Memory B cells can be generated through heterogeneous pathways within and outside germinal centers (GCs). Once developed, they appear to be maintained like stem cells for long periods by homeostatic proliferation. In response to reencountered antigens, memory B cells robustly secrete antibodies with help of the anti-apoptotic effect of Ras-mediated signals. We have recently found that following intranasal infection with an influenza virus, virus-specific memory B cells develop in the lungs and persist for a long time along with GC B cells and plasma cells; this appears to be unique feature of the mucosal memory response. Thus memory B cell responses in the systemic and mucosal sites are regulated by distinct processes and further understanding of them should provide a theoretical framework for the development of new vaccine strategies.},

abstract = {Humoral immunity, in particular secreted neutralizing antibodies, is of central importance to protect the body against acutely cytopathic viruses, whereas noncytopathic viruses have found ways of balanced coexistence with the immune system to avoid antibody-mediated elimination. There is evidence that polyspecific "natural" antibodies provide early protection, independent of T cell help. If that line of defense is crossed, T cell-dependent immune responses then generate a humoral memory provided by long-lived plasma cells secreting specific antibodies of adapted avidity and function, i.e., isotype, even in the absence of virus. Secreted protective antibodies of humoral memory provide an efficient line of defense against reinfection and are backed up by specific B and T memory cells of reactive memory. Whereas humoral memory has developed effective antiviral protection, some viruses (i.e., HIV) have managed to develop specific evasion strategies to escape it. Thus, coevolution provides us with some insight into just how substantial antiviral antibodies and memory B cell are in protecting the host from virus infection.},

PCR analyses with DNA of single cells developed by others and by us have been used to monitor the conformation of the Ig H and L chain gene loci in these different B lineage subpopulations. The results of these analyses indicate that B220+/c-kit+/CD25- cells are the precursors of large B220+/CD25+/sIgM- which, in turn, are the precursors of small B220+/CD25+/sIgM- cells. The majority of B220+/c-kit+/CD25- cells are DHJH-rearranged, with L chain loci in germline configuration and are thus pre-B I cells. More than 90% of all large B220+/CD25+/sIgM- cells have at least one H chain locus VHDHJH rearranged; half of them have also the second locus VHDHJH rearranged and are thus large pre-B II cells. Rearrangements of at least one allele of the kappa L chain loci become detectable in 65% of the small B220+/CD25+/sIgM- cells, 67% of the immature B and > 75% of the mature B cells. The ratio of kappa L to lambda L gene rearrangements in all three subpopulations is approximately 10:1, indicating that the kappa L/lambda L ratio is established as soon as rearrangements are made.},

abstract = {Incorporation of effective backbone sampling into protein simulation and design is an important step in increasing the accuracy of computational protein modeling. Recent analysis of high-resolution crystal structures has suggested a new model, termed backrub, to describe localized, hinge-like alternative backbone and side-chain conformations observed in the crystal lattice. The model involves internal backbone rotations about axes between C-alpha atoms. Based on this observation, we have implemented a backrub-inspired sampling method in the Rosetta structure prediction and design program. We evaluate this model of backbone flexibility using three different tests. First, we show that Rosetta backrub simulations recapitulate the correlation between backbone and side-chain conformations in the high-resolution crystal structures upon which the model was based. As a second test of backrub sampling, we show that backbone flexibility improves the accuracy of predicting point-mutant side-chain conformations over fixed backbone rotameric sampling alone. Finally, we show that backrub sampling of triosephosphate isomerase loop 6 can capture the millisecond/microsecond oscillation between the open and closed states observed in solution. Our results suggest that backrub sampling captures a sizable fraction of localized conformational changes that occur in natural proteins. Application of this simple model of backbone motions may significantly improve both protein design and atomistic simulations of localized protein flexibility.},

abstract = {Despite having irregular structure, protein loops often adopt specific conformations that are critical to protein function. Most studies in de novo protein design have focused on creating proteins with regular elements of secondary structure connected by very short loops or turns. To design longer protein loops that adopt specific conformations, we have developed a protocol within the Rosetta molecular modeling program that iterates between optimizing the sequence and conformation of a loop in search of low-energy sequence-structure pairs. We have tested the procedure by designing 10-residue loops for the connection between the second and third strand in the beta-sandwich protein tenascin. Three low-energy designs from 7,200 flexible backbone trajectories were selected for experimental characterization. All three designs, called LoopA, LoopB, and LoopC, adopt stable folded structures. High-resolution crystal structures of LoopA and LoopB have been solved. LoopB adopts a structure very similar to the design model (0.46 A rmsd), and all but one of the side chains are modeled in the correct rotamers. LoopA crystallized at low pH in a structure that differs dramatically from our design model. It forms a strand-swapped dimer mediated by hydrogen bonds to protonated glutamic acids. Gel filtration indicates that the protein is not a dimer at neutral pH. These results suggest that the high-resolution design of protein loops is possible; however, they also highlight how small changes in protein energetics can dramatically perturb the low free energy structure of a protein.},

abstract = {To generate structures consistent with both the local and nonlocal interactions responsible for protein stability, 3 and 9 residue fragments of known structures with local sequences similar to the target sequence were assembled into complete tertiary structures using a Monte Carlo simulated annealing procedure (Simons et al., J Mol Biol 1997; 268:209-225). The scoring function used in the simulated annealing procedure consists of sequence-dependent terms representing hydrophobic burial and specific pair interactions such as electrostatics and disulfide bonding and sequence-independent terms representing hard sphere packing, alpha-helix and beta-strand packing, and the collection of beta-strands in beta-sheets (Simons et al., Proteins 1999;34:82-95). For each of 21 small, ab initio targets, 1,200 final structures were constructed, each the result of 100,000 attempted fragment substitutions. The five structures submitted for the CASP III experiment were chosen from the approximately 25 structures with the lowest scores in the broadest minima (assessed through the number of structural neighbors; Shortle et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1998;95:1158-1162). The results were encouraging: highlights of the predictions include a 99-residue segment for MarA with an rmsd of 6.4 A to the native structure, a 95-residue (full length) prediction for the EH2 domain of EPS15 with an rmsd of 6.0 A, a 75-residue segment of DNAB helicase with an rmsd of 4.7 A, and a 67-residue segment of ribosomal protein L30 with an rmsd of 3.8 A. These results suggest that ab initio methods may soon become useful for low-resolution structure prediction for proteins that lack a close homologue of known structure.},

Although conformational adjustments are frequently observed between the free and ligand-bound states, the conformational flexibility of the protein is typically ignored in protein-small molecule docking programs. We previously described the program RosettaLigand, which leverages the Rosetta energy function and side-chain repacking algorithm to account for flexibility of all side chains in the binding site. Here we present extensions to RosettaLigand that incorporate full ligand flexibility as well as receptor backbone flexibility. Including receptor backbone flexibility is found to produce more correct docked complexes and to lower the average RMSD of the best-scoring docked poses relative to the rigid-backbone results. On a challenging set of retrospective and prospective cross-docking tests, we find that the top-scoring ligand pose is correctly positioned within 2 A RMSD for 64% (54/85) of cases overall.},

abstract = {Interleaved dimers and higher order symmetric oligomers are ubiquitous in biology but present a challenge to de novo structure prediction methodology: The structure adopted by a monomer can be stabilized largely by interactions with other monomers and hence not the lowest energy state of a single chain. Building on the Rosetta framework, we present a general method to simultaneously model the folding and docking of multiple-chain interleaved homo-oligomers. For more than a third of the cases in a benchmark set of interleaved homo-oligomers, the method generates near-native models of large alpha-helical bundles, interlocking beta sandwiches, and interleaved alpha/beta motifs with an accuracy high enough for molecular replacement based phasing. With the incorporation of NMR chemical shift information, accurate models can be obtained consistently for symmetric complexes with as many as 192 total amino acids; a blind prediction was within 1 A rmsd of the traditionally determined NMR structure, and fit independently collected RDC data equally well. Together, these results show that the Rosetta "fold-and-dock" protocol can produce models of homo-oligomeric complexes with near-atomic-level accuracy and should be useful for crystallographic phasing and the rapid determination of the structures of multimers with limited NMR information.},

abstract = {Science responded to the challenge of AIDS by rapidly identifying aetiology, describing pathogenesis and transmission routes, and developing diagnostic tests and treatment. However, this did not prevent the global spread of HIV, with 25 million fatal cases so far, another 33 million infected, and disastrous socioeconomic and demographic consequences. In spite of unprecedented political attention and financial resources, the response is falling further behind the growth of the epidemic. This is partly due to the unique characteristics of the virus, such as persistent infection, vertical transmission and a variability that allows it to escape immunity and antiretroviral drugs, and partly due to human characteristics such as a strong procreative instinct, drug use and ostracism. Denial, myths and complacency are major obstacles to rational measures. With no cure or vaccine in sight, scaling up prevention is of paramount importance. To meet the goal of universal access to prevention, treatment and care by 2010 would require a quadrupling of funding to an estimated US$42 billion by 2010, including adequate overall strengthening of healthcare systems, but in any case, the world will have to learn to live with HIV for the foreseeable future.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the in-vivo efficacy of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against HIV-1, to discuss the recent finding that an engineered human antibody VH domain, domain antibody (dAb), exhibits exceptionally potent and broadly cross-reactive neutralizing activity against HIV-1 primary isolates by targeting a hidden conserved epitope that is not accessible by larger antibodies and to suggest the possibility of developing a novel class of potent HIV-1 inhibitors based on human dAbs. RECENT FINDINGS: HIV-1 has evolved a number of strategies to evade humoral immunity, including protecting highly conserved and important structures from the access of antibodies generated by the immune system. We have recently demonstrated that a human dAb (size approximately 15 kDa), m36, targets a highly protected structure on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), gp120, and exhibits exceptionally potent neutralizing activity against HIV-1 primary isolates, with potency on average higher than those of the broadly cross-reactive neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, scFv m9, and the inhibitory peptide, C34. SUMMARY: The efficacy of the anti-HIV-1 therapy is significantly compromised by resistance to the currently used US Food and Drug Administration-approved antiretroviral drugs, which suggests an urgent need to develop novel classes of potent inhibitors. Several broadly cross-reactive neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies are highly effective against HIV-1 infection in vitro, but their administration to HIV-1-infected humans has only resulted in modest antiviral effects. Engineered human antibody fragments, dAbs, could be more potent because of their small size (about 10-fold smaller than that of an IgG), which allows targeting of highly conserved structures on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein that are not accessible by full-size antibodies and relatively efficient penetration into the densely packed lymphoid environment in which HIV-1 mostly replicates and spreads.},

abstract = {Some protein design tasks cannot be modeled by the traditional single state design strategy of finding a sequence that is optimal for a single fixed backbone. Such cases require multistate design, where a single sequence is threaded onto multiple backbones (states) and evaluated for its strengths and weaknesses on each backbone. For example, to design a protein that can switch between two specific conformations, it is necessary to to find a sequence that is compatible with both backbone conformations. We present in this paper a generic implementation of multistate design that is suited for a wide range of protein design tasks and demonstrate in silico its capabilities at two design tasks: one of redesigning an obligate homodimer into an obligate heterodimer such that the new monomers would not homodimerize, and one of redesigning a promiscuous interface to bind to only a single partner and to no longer bind the rest of its partners. Both tasks contained negative design in that multistate design was asked to find sequences that would produce high energies for several of the states being modeled. Success at negative design was assessed by computationally redocking the undesired protein-pair interactions; we found that multistate design's accuracy improved as the diversity of conformations for the undesired protein-pair interactions increased. The paper concludes with a discussion of the pitfalls of negative design, which has proven considerably more challenging than positive design.},

Crystal structures of Fab 2G12 and its complexes with the disaccharide Manalpha1-2Man and with the oligosaccharide Man9GlcNAc2 revealed that two Fabs assemble into an interlocked VH domain-swapped dimer. Further biochemical, biophysical, and mutagenesis data strongly support a Fab-dimerized antibody as the prevalent form that recognizes gp120. The extraordinary configuration of this antibody provides an extended surface, with newly described binding sites, for multivalent interaction with a conserved cluster of oligomannose type sugars on the surface of gp120. The unique interdigitation of Fab domains within an antibody uncovers a previously unappreciated mechanism for high-affinity recognition of carbohydrate or other repeating epitopes on cell or microbial surfaces.},

abstract = {2F5 is a monoclonal antibody with potent and broadly neutralizing activity against HIV-1. It targets the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the gp41 subunit of the envelope glycoprotein and interferes with the process of fusion between viral and host cell membranes. This study presents eight 2F5 F(ab)' crystal structures in complex with various gp41 peptide epitopes. These structures reveal several key features of this antibody-antigen interaction. (1) Whenever free of contacts caused by crystal artifacts, the extended complementarity-determining region H3 loop is mobile; this is true for ligand-free and epitope-bound forms. (2) The interaction between the antibody and the gp41 ELDKWA epitope core is absolutely critical, and there are also close and specific contacts with residues located N-terminal to the epitope core. (3) Residues located at the C-terminus of the gp41 ELDKWA core do not interact as tightly with the antibody. However, in the presence of a larger peptide containing the gp41 fusion peptide segment, these residues adopt a conformation consistent with the start of an alpha-helix. (4) At high sulfate concentrations, the electron density maps of 2F5 F(ab)'-peptide complexes contain a peak that may mark a binding site for phosphate groups of negatively charged lipid headgroups. The refined atomic-level details of 2F5 paratope-epitope interactions revealed here should contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of 2F5-based virus neutralization, in general, and prove important for the design of potential vaccine candidates intended to elicit 2F5-like antibody production.},

abstract = {Potent, broadly HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) may be invaluable for the design of an AIDS vaccine. 4E10 is the broadest HIV-1 nAb known to date and recognizes a contiguous and highly conserved helical epitope in the membrane-proximal region of gp41. The 4E10 epitope is thus an excellent target for vaccine design as it is also highly amenable to peptide engineering to enhance its helical character. To investigate the structural effect of both increasing the peptide length and of introducing helix-promoting constraints in the 4E10 epitope, we have determined crystal structures of Fab 4E10 bound to an optimized peptide epitope (NWFDITNWLWYIKKKK-NH(2)), an Aib-constrained peptide epitope (NWFDITNAibLWRR-NH(2)), and a thioether-linked peptide (NWFCITOWLWKKKK-NH(2)) to resolutions of 1.7 A, 2.1 A, and 2.2 A, respectively. The thioether-linked peptide is the first reported structure of a cyclic tethered helical peptide bound to an antibody. The introduced helix constraints limit the conformational flexibility of the peptides without affecting interactions with 4E10. The substantial increase in affinity (10 nM versus 10(4) nM of the IC(50) of the original KGND peptide template) is largely realized by 4E10 interaction with an additional helical turn at the peptide C terminus that includes Leu679 and Trp680. Thus, the core 4E10 epitope was extended and modified to a WFX(I/L)(T/S)XX(L/I)W motif, where X does not play a major role in 4E10 binding and can be used to introduce helical-promoting constraints in the peptide epitope.},

abstract = {Methods for rapid and reliable design and structure prediction of linker loops would facilitate a variety of protein engineering applications. Circular permutation, in which the existing termini of a protein are linked by the polypeptide chain and new termini are created, is one such application that has been employed for decreasing proteolytic susceptibility and other functional purposes. The length and sequence of the linker can impact the expression level, solubility, structure and function of the permuted variants. Hence it is desirable to achieve atomic-level accuracy in linker design. Here, we describe the use of RosettaRemodel for design and structure prediction of circular permutation linkers on a model protein. A crystal structure of one of the permuted variants confirmed the accuracy of the computational prediction, where the all-atom rmsd of the linker region was 0.89 {\AA} between the model and the crystal structure. This result suggests that RosettaRemodel may be generally useful for the design and structure prediction of protein loop regions for circular permutations or other structure-function manipulations.},

abstract = {Advances in structural genomics and protein structure prediction require the design of automatic, fast, objective, and well benchmarked methods capable of comparing and assessing the similarity of low-resolution three-dimensional structures, via experimental or theoretical approaches. Here, a new method for sequence-independent structural alignment is presented that allows comparison of an experimental protein structure with an arbitrary low-resolution protein tertiary model. The heuristic algorithm is given and then used to show that it can describe random structural alignments of proteins with different folds with good accuracy by an extreme value distribution. From this observation, a structural similarity score between two proteins or two different conformations of the same protein is derived from the likelihood of obtaining a given structural alignment by chance. The performance of the derived score is then compared with well established, consensus manual-based scores and data sets. We found that the new approach correlates better than other tools with the gold standard provided by a human evaluator. Timings indicate that the algorithm is fast enough for routine use with large databases of protein models. Overall, our results indicate that the new program (MAMMOTH) will be a good tool for protein structure comparisons in structural genomics applications.

abstract = {Computational grafting of functional motifs onto scaffold proteins is a promising way to engineer novel proteins with pre-specified functionalities. Typically, protein grafting involves the transplantation of protein side chains from a functional motif onto structurally homologous regions of scaffold proteins. Using this approach, we previously transplanted the human immunodeficiency virus 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes onto heterologous proteins to design novel "epitope-scaffold" antigens. However, side-chain grafting is limited by the availability of scaffolds with compatible backbone for a given epitope structure and offers no route to modify backbone structure to improve mimicry or binding affinity. To address this, we report here a new and more aggressive computational method-backbone grafting of linear motifs-that transplants the backbone and side chains of linear functional motifs onto scaffold proteins. To test this method, we first used side-chain grafting to design new 2F5 epitope scaffolds with improved biophysical characteristics. We then independently transplanted the 2F5 epitope onto three of the same parent scaffolds using the newly developed backbone grafting procedure. Crystal structures of side-chain and backbone grafting designs showed close agreement with both the computational models and the desired epitope structure. In two cases, backbone grafting scaffolds bound antibody 2F5 with 30- and 9-fold higher affinity than corresponding side-chain grafting designs. These results demonstrate that flexible backbone methods for epitope grafting can significantly improve binding affinities over those achieved by fixed backbone methods alone. Backbone grafting of linear motifs is a general method to transplant functional motifs when backbone remodeling of the target scaffold is necessary.},

abstract = {Protein-protein docking algorithms provide a means to elucidate structural details for presently unknown complexes. Here, we present and evaluate a new method to predict protein-protein complexes from the coordinates of the unbound monomer components. The method employs a low-resolution, rigid-body, Monte Carlo search followed by simultaneous optimization of backbone displacement and side-chain conformations using Monte Carlo minimization. Up to 10(5) independent simulations are carried out, and the resulting "decoys" are ranked using an energy function dominated by van der Waals interactions, an implicit solvation model, and an orientation-dependent hydrogen bonding potential. Top-ranking decoys are clustered to select the final predictions. Small-perturbation studies reveal the formation of binding funnels in 42 of 54 cases using coordinates derived from the bound complexes and in 32 of 54 cases using independently determined coordinates of one or both monomers. Experimental binding affinities correlate with the calculated score function and explain the predictive success or failure of many targets. Global searches using one or both unbound components predict at least 25% of the native residue-residue contacts in 28 of the 32 cases where binding funnels exist. The results suggest that the method may soon be useful for generating models of biologically important complexes from the structures of the isolated components, but they also highlight the challenges that must be met to achieve consistent and accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Dying cells stimulate inflammation, and this response is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases. Very little has been known, however, about how cell death triggers inflammation. We found here that the acute neutrophilic inflammatory response to cell injury requires the signaling protein myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88). Analysis of the contribution of Myd88-dependent receptors to this response revealed only a minor reduction in mice doubly deficient in Toll-like receptor 2 (Tlr2) and Tlr4 and normal responses in mice lacking Tlr1, Tlr3, Tlr6, Tlr7, Tlr9, Tlr11 or the interleukin-18 receptor (IL-18R). However, mice lacking IL-1R showed a markedly reduced neutrophilic inflammatory response to dead cells and tissue injury in vivo as well as greatly decreased collateral damage from inflammation. This inflammatory response required IL-1alpha, and IL-1R function was required on non-bone-marrow-derived cells. Notably, the acute monocyte response to cell death, which is thought to be important for tissue repair, was much less dependent on the IL-1R-Myd88 pathway. Also, this pathway was not required for the neutrophil response to a microbial stimulus. These findings suggest that inhibiting the IL-1R-Myd88 pathway in vivo could block the damage from acute inflammation that occurs in response to sterile cell death, and do so in a way that might not compromise tissue repair or host defense against pathogens.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the causative agent of AIDS and the subject of intense study. The immature HIV-1 particle is traditionally described as having a well ordered, icosahedral structure made up of uncleaved Gag protein surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing envelope proteins. Expression of the Gag protein in eukaryotic cells leads to the budding of membranous virus-like particles (VLPs). RESULTS: We have used cryo-electron microscopy of VLPs from insect cells and lightly fixed, immature HIV-1 particles from human lymphocytes to determine their organization. Both types of particle were heterogeneous in size, varying in diameter from 1200-2600 A. Larger particles appeared to be broken into semi-spherical sectors, each having a radius of curvature of approximately 750 A. No evidence of icosahedral symmetry was found, but local order was evidenced by small arrays of Gag protein that formed facets within the curved sectors. A consistent 270 A radial density was seen, which included a 70 A wide low density feature corresponding to the carboxy-terminal portion of the membrane attached matrix protein and the amino-terminal portion of the capsid protein. CONCLUSIONS: Immature HIV-1 particles and VLPs both have a multi-sector structure characterized, not by an icosahedral organization, but by local order in which the structures of the matrix and capsid regions of Gag change upon cleavage. We propose a model in which lateral interactions between Gag protein molecules yields arrays that are organized into sectors for budding by RNA.},

Crystal structures show that in the absence of antigen the secondary antibody adopts a structure preformed for binding, but that the primary antibody does not.

Some of the proteins needed only a single side-chain alteration in order to associate to a higher-order complex. The mobility of the buried side chains has to be taken into account.

abstract = {Accommodating backbone flexibility continues to be the most difficult challenge in computational docking of protein-protein complexes. Towards that end, we simulate four distinct biophysical models of protein binding in RosettaDock, a multiscale Monte-Carlo-based algorithm that uses a quasi-kinetic search process to emulate the diffusional encounter of two proteins and to identify low-energy complexes. The four binding models are as follows: (1) key-lock (KL) model, using rigid-backbone docking; (2) conformer selection (CS) model, using a novel ensemble docking algorithm; (3) induced fit (IF) model, using energy-gradient-based backbone minimization; and (4) combined conformer selection/induced fit (CS/IF) model. Backbone flexibility was limited to the smaller partner of the complex, structural ensembles were generated using Rosetta refinement methods, and docking consisted of local perturbations around the complexed conformation using unbound component crystal structures for a set of 21 target complexes. The lowest-energy structure contained >30% of the native residue-residue contacts for 9, 13, 13, and 14 targets for KL, CS, IF, and CS/IF docking, respectively. When applied to 15 targets using nuclear magnetic resonance ensembles of the smaller protein, the lowest-energy structure recovered at least 30% native residue contacts in 3, 8, 4, and 8 targets for KL, CS, IF, and CS/IF docking, respectively. CS/IF docking of the nuclear magnetic resonance ensemble performed equally well or better than KL docking with the unbound crystal structure in 10 of 15 cases. The marked success of CS and CS/IF docking shows that ensemble docking can be a versatile and effective method for accommodating conformational plasticity in docking and serves as a demonstration for the CS theory--that binding-competent conformers exist in the unbound ensemble and can be selected based on their favorable binding energies.},

abstract = {The immune system responds to the introduction of foreign antigens by rapidly evolving antibodies with increasing affinity for the antigen (i.e., maturation). To investigate the factors that control this process at the molecular level, we have assessed the changes in flexibility that accompany ligand binding at four stages of maturation in the 4-4-20 antibody. Our studies, based on molecular dynamics, indicate that increased affinity for the target ligand is associated with a decreased entropic cost to binding. The entropy of binding is unfavorable, opposing favorable enthalpic contributions that arise during complex formation. Computed binding free energies for the various antibody-ligand complexes qualitatively reproduce the trends observed in the experimentally derived values, although the absolute magnitude of free-energy differences is overestimated. Our results support the existence of a correlation between high-affinity interactions and decreased protein flexibility in this series of antibody molecules. This observation is likely to be a general feature of molecular association processes and key to the molecular evolution of antibody responses.},

abstract = {Rational engineering methods can be applied with reasonable success to optimize physicochemical characteristics of proteins, in particular, antibodies. Here, we describe a combined CDR3 walking randomization and rational design-based approach to enhance the affinity of the human anti-gastrin TA4 scFv. The application of this methodology to TA4 scFv, displaying only a weak overall affinity for gastrin17 (K(D) = 6 microM), resulted in a set of nine affinity-matured scFv variants with near-nanomolar affinity (K(D) = 13.2 nM for scFv TA4.112). First, CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 randomization resulted in three scFvs with an overall affinity improvement of 15- to 35-fold over the parental. Then, the modeling of two scFv constructs selected from the previous step (TA4.11 and TA4.13) was followed by a combination of manual and molecular dynamics-based docking of gastrin17 into the respective binding sites, analysis of apparent packing defects, and selection of residues for mutagenesis through phage display. Nine scFv mutants were obtained from the second maturation step. A final 454-fold improvement in affinity compared with TA4 was obtained. These scFvs showed an enhanced potency to inhibit gastrin-induced proliferation in Colo 320 WT and BxPc3 tumoral cells. In conclusion, we propose a structure-based rational method to accelerate the development of affinity-matured antibody constructs with enhanced potential for therapeutic use.},

abstract = {Antibodies HyHEL8, HyHEL10, and HyHEL26 (HH8, HH10, and HH26, respectively) recognize highly overlapping epitopes on hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) with similar affinities, but with different specificities. HH8 binding to HEL is least sensitive toward mutations in the epitope and thus is most cross-reactive, HH26 is most sensitive, whereas the sensitivity of HH10 lies in between HH8 and HH26. Here we have investigated intra- and intermolecular interactions in three antibody-protein complexes: theoretical models of HH8-HEL and HH26-HEL complexes, and the x-ray crystal structure of HH10-HEL complex. Our results show that HH8-HEL has the lowest number and HH26-HEL has the highest number of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The number of salt bridges is lowest in HH8-HEL and highest in HH26-HEL. The binding site salt bridges in HH8-HEL are not networked, and are weak, whereas, in HH26-HEL, an intramolecular salt-bridge triad at the binding site is networked to an intermolecular triad to form a pentad. The pentad and each salt bridge of this pentad are exceptionally stabilizing. The number of binding-site salt bridges and their strengths are intermediate in HH10-HEL, with an intramolecular triad. Our further calculations show that the electrostatic component contributes the most to binding energy of HH26-HEL, whereas the hydrophobic component contributes the most in the case of HH8-HEL. A "hot-spot" epitope residue Lys-97 forms an intermolecular salt bridge in HH8-HEL, and participates in the intermolecular pentad in the HH26-HEL complex. Mutant modeling and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies show that this hot-spot epitope residue contributes significantly more to the binding than an adjacent epitope residue, Lys-96, which does not form a salt bridge in any of the three HH-HEL complexes. Furthermore, the effect of mutating Lys-97 is most severe in HH26-HEL. Lys-96, being a charged residue, also contributes the most in HH26-HEL among the three complexes. The SPR results on these mutants also highlight that the apparent "electrostatic steering" on net on rates actually act at post-collision level stabilization of the complex. The significance of this work is the observed variations in electrostatic interactions among the three complexes. Our work demonstrates that higher electrostatics, both as a number of short-range electrostatic interactions and their contributions, leads to higher binding specificity. Strong salt bridges, their networking, and electrostatically driven binding, limit flexibilities through geometric constrains. In contrast, hydrophobic driven binding and low levels of electrostatic interactions are associated with conformational flexibility and cross-reactivity.},

However, our first glimpses of the recombined products of this combinatorial gene system were in the 1970s, in landmark publications, reporting the crystal structures of two human myeloma proteins, the Mcg lambda light chain dimer and the New IgG1(lambda) Fab. Although numerous crystal structures of murine and human antibodies have now been determined, only a relatively small proportion of the human germline genes have had their corresponding protein three-dimensional structures resolved. Therefore, further structural investigations are required before the inherent diversity of the antibody repertoire can be fully appreciated. We discuss the detailed structural information available for human antibodies with regard to their immune functions. Also discussed, is how the structural information is finding application in the 'humanization' of murine antibodies as part of their development as 'biopharmaceuticals' for the treatment of human disease.},

abstract = {The anti-hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) antibodies HyHEL-10 and F9.13.7 recognize a common epitope. The structures of the complexes differ, however, in the numbers of electrostatic and hydrogen-bond interactions and in the distributions of contacts between the light and heavy chains. The equilibria and kinetics characterizing the F9.13.7 complex formation were evaluated for both wild-type and mutant derivatives of HEWL to help to understand how the different contacts are effectively used in the complexes with the two antibodies. Three epitope hot spots, Y20, K96, and R73 (destabilization > 4 kcal/mole), were found by alanine scanning mutagenesis. The first two constitute two of the three hot spots in the HyHEL-10 complex. The hot spots of the HyHEL-10 paratope are centered on the HEWL epitope; whereas R73 (HEWL), the only important light-chain-contacting residue, is clearly separated from the other hot spots of the F9.13.7 complex. The larger number of epitope warm plus hot spots found in the F9.13.7 complex compared with that of HyHEL-10 shows that the specificity of the former is greater even though the K(D) value is 20-fold larger. Conservative mutations showed that the specificity enhancement is related to the greater number of functional polar and hydrogen bond interactions in the F9.13.7 complex. Alanine scanning mutagenesis would not have illuminated these distinctions. It is shown that the concept of antigen specificity, as defined by cross-reactivity with natural variant antigens, is flawed by phylogenetic bias, and that specificity can only be defined by the use of unbiased epitopes, which are conveniently accessed by site-directed mutagenesis.},

The mAb is used to select specific phages from combinatorial phage-display peptide libraries that in turn are used as an epitope-defining database that is applied via a novel computer algorithm to analyze the crystalline structure of the original antigen. The algorithm is based on the following: (1) Most contacts between a mAb and an antigen are through side-chain atoms of the residues. (2) In the three-dimensional structure of a protein, amino acid residues remote in linear sequence can juxtapose to one another through folding. (3) Tandem amino acid residues of the selected phage-displayed peptides can represent pairs of juxtaposed amino acid residues of the antigen. (4) Contact residues of the epitope are accessible to the antigen surface. (5) The most frequent tandem pairs of amino acid residues in the selected phage-displayed peptides can reflect pairs of juxtaposed amino acid residues of the epitope. Application of the algorithm enabled prediction of epitopes. On the basis of these predictions, segments of an antigen were used to reconstitute an antigenic epitope mimetic that was recognized by its original mAb.},

abstract = {Rapid elucidation of neutralizing antibody epitopes on emerging viral pathogens like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) or highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus is of great importance for rational design of vaccines against these viruses. Here we combined screening of phage display random peptide libraries with a unique computer algorithm "Mapitope" to identify the discontinuous epitope of 80R, a potent neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody against the spike protein. Using two different types of random peptide libraries which display cysteine-constrained loops or linear 13-15-mer peptides, independent panels containing 42 and 18 peptides were isolated, respectively. These peptides, which had no apparent homologous motif within or between the peptide pools and spike protein, were deconvoluted into amino acid pairs (AAPs) by Mapitope and the statistically significant pairs (SSPs) were defined. Mapitope analysis of the peptides was first performed on a theoretical model of the spike and later on the genuine crystal structure. Three clusters (A, B and C) were predicted on both structures with remarkable overlap. Cluster A ranked the highest in the algorithm in both models and coincided well with the sites of spike protein that are in contact with the receptor, consistent with the observation that 80R functions as a potent entry inhibitor. This study demonstrates that by using this novel strategy one can rapidly predict and identify a neutralizing antibody epitope, even in the absence of the crystal structure of its target protein.},

For detectable triggering, the antigen/BCR complex needed a Ka > 10(6) M(-1) (dissociation half-life > approximately 1 s). Mutated lysozymes whose binding was below this threshold could nevertheless be presented if complexed with soluble antibody. Above the threshold, the concentration of antigen required to trigger a response decreased as the affinity (particularly dissociation half-life) increased. However, a plateau was reached at Kas > approximately 10(10) M(-1) (dissociation half-life > 0.5 hr), supporting the idea of a ceiling to affinity maturation.},

abstract = {The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with the development of numerous malignancies, including the epithelial malignancy nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The viral oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is expressed in almost all EBV-associated malignancies and has profound effects on gene expression. LMP1 acts as a constitutively active tumor necrosis factor receptor and activates multiple forms of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. LMP1 has two domains that both activate NF-kappaB. In epithelial cells, LMP1 C-terminal activating region 1 (CTAR1) uniquely activates p50/p50-, p50/p52-, and p65-containing complexes while CTAR2 activates canonical p50/p65 complexes. CTAR1 also uniquely upregulates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In NPC, NF-kappaB p50/p50 homodimers and the transactivator Bcl-3 were detected on the EGFR promoter. In this study, the role of NF-kappaB p50 and Bcl-3 in LMP1-mediated upregulation of EGFR was analyzed. In LMP1-CTAR1-expressing cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation detected p50 and Bcl-3 on the NF-kappaB consensus sites within the egfr promoter. Transient overexpression of p50 and Bcl-3 increased EGFR expression, confirming the regulation of EGFR by these factors. Treatment with p105/p50 siRNA effectively reduced p105/p50 levels but unexpectedly increased Bcl-3 expression and levels of p50/Bcl-3 complexes, resulting in increased EGFR expression. These data suggest that induction of p50/p50/Bcl-3 complexes by LMP1 CTAR1 mediates LMP1-induced EGFR upregulation and that formation of the p50/p50/Bcl-3 complex is negatively regulated by the p105 precursor. The distinct forms of NF-kappaB that are induced by LMP1 CTAR1 likely activate distinct cellular genes.},

The aggregation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) on the surface of mast cells initiates a complex cascade of signaling events that ultimately leads to the release of various mediators involved in allergic inflammation and anaphylactic reactions. The release of these mediators is tightly controlled by signaling pathways that are propagated through the cell by specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. These events are controlled by protein kinases and protein phosphatases which either positively or negatively regulate the propagation of the signal through the cell.

abstract = {Research into the five Toll/IL1 receptor (TIR) adaptor proteins involved in innate immunity continues to advance. Here we outline some of the more recent findings. MyD88 has a key role in signalling by the IL1 receptor complex and TLRs. However, a MyD88-independent pathway of IL1beta signalling in neurons has been described which involves the protein kinase Akt, and which has an anti-apoptotic effect. This pathway may also be important for the mechanism whereby Alum exerts its adjuvant effect since this depends on IL1beta but is MyD88-independent. MyD88 is also involved in tumourigenesis in models of hepatocarcinoma and familial associated polyposis (FAP); negative regulation of TLR3 signalling and in PKCepsilon activation. The adaptor Mal is regulated by phosphorylation and caspase-1 cleavage. A variant form of Mal in humans termed S180L confers protection in multiple infectious diseases. TRAM is controlled by myristoylation and phosphorylation and the localisation of TRAM with TLR4 to endosomes is required for activation of IRF3 and induction of IFNbeta. Finally SARM has been shown to regulate TRIF and also appears to be involved in neuronal injury mediated by oxidative stress in mouse neurons. These advances confirm the importance for the TIR domain-containing adapters in host defence and inflammation.},

abstract = {Research into intracellular sensing of microbial products is an up and coming field in innate immunity. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize Brucella spp. and bacterial components and initiate mononuclear phagocyte responses that influence both innate and adaptive immunity. Recent studies have revealed the intracellular signaling cascades involved in the TLR-initiated immune response to Brucella infection. TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 have been implicated in host interactions with Brucella; however, TLR9 has the most prominent role. Further, the relationship between specific Brucella molecules and various signal transduction pathways needs to be better understood. MyD88-dependent and TRIF-independent signaling pathways are involved in Brucella activation of innate immune cells through TLRs. We have recently reported the critical role of MyD88 molecule in dendritic cell maturation and interleukin-12 production during B. abortus infection. This article discusses recent studies on TLR signaling and also highlights the contribution of NOD and type I IFN receptors during Brucella infection. The better understanding of the role by such innate immune receptors in bacterial infection is critical in host-pathogen interactions.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) is important in protection against lethal Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) infection. Control of the early stages of sublethal S. Typhimurium infection in mice depends on TLR4-dependent activation of macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells to drive an inflammatory response. TLR4 signals through the adapter proteins Mal/MyD88 and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM)/TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-b (TRIF). In the mouse typhoid model we showed that TLR4 and MyD88, but not Mal or TRIF, are essential for the control of exponential S. Typhimurium growth. TRIF(-/-) mice have a higher bacterial load in comparison with wild-type mice during a sublethal infection because TRIF is important for bacterial killing during the first day of systemic disease. Minimal pro-inflammatory responses were induced by S. Typhimurium infection of macrophages from TLR4(-/-), MyD88(-/-) and TRIF(-/-) mice in vitro. Pro-inflammatory responses from Mal(-/-) macrophages were similar to those from wild-type cells. The pro-inflammatory responses of TRIF(-/-) macrophages were partially restored by the addition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and TRIF(-/-) mice produced markedly enhanced IFN-gamma levels, in comparison to wild-type mice, probably explaining why bacterial growth can be controlled in these mice. TLR4(-/-), MyD88(-/-), TRIF(-/-) and Mal(-/-) mice all initiated clearance of S. Typhimurium, suggesting that TLR4 signalling is not important in driving bacterial clearance in comparison to its critical role in controlling early bacterial growth in mouse typhoid.},

abstract = {Viral RNA or bacterial products can activate glomerular mesangial cells via a subset of Toll-like receptors (Tlr). Because Tlr2-deficient mice were recently found to have attenuated nephrotoxic serum nephritis (NSN), we hypothesized that endogenous Tlr agonists can activate glomerular mesangial cells. Primary mesangial cells from C57BL/6 mice expressed Tlr1-6 and Tlr11 mRNA at considerable levels and produced Il-6 when being exposed to the respective Tlr ligands. Exposure to necrotic cells activated cultured primary mesangial cells to produce Il-6 in a Tlr2/Myd88-dependent manner. Apoptotic cells activated cultured mesangial cells only when being enriched to high numbers. Apoptotic cell-induced Il-6 release was Myd88 dependent, and only purified apoptotic cell RNA induced Trif signaling in mesangial cells. Does Trif signaling contribute to disease activity in glomerulonephritis? To answer this question, we induced autologous NSN by injection of NS raised in rabbits in Trif-mutant and wild-type mice. Lack of Trif did not alter the functional and histomorphological abnormalities of NSN, including the evolution of anti-rabbit IgG and anti-rabbit-specific nephritogenic T cells. We therefore conclude that apoptotic cell RNA is a poor activator of Trif signaling in mesangial cells and that necrotic cells' releases rather activate mesangial cells via the Tlr2/Myd88 signaling pathway.},

abstract = {The ubiquitin-conjugation system regulates a vast range of biological phenomena by affecting protein function mostly through polyubiquitin conjugation. The type of polyubiquitin chain that is generated seems to determine how conjugated proteins are regulated, as they are recognized specifically by proteins that contain chain-specific ubiquitin-binding motifs. An enzyme complex that catalyses the formation of newly described linear polyubiquitin chains--known as linear ubiquitin chain-assembly complex (LUBAC)--has recently been characterized, as has a particular ubiquitin-binding domain that specifically recognizes linear chains. Both have been shown to have crucial roles in the canonical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-activation pathway. The ubiquitin system is intimately involved in regulating the NF-kappaB pathway, and the regulatory roles of K63-linked chains have been studied extensively. However, the role of linear chains in this process is only now emerging. This article discusses the possible mechanisms underlying linear polyubiquitin-mediated activation of NF-kappaB, and the different roles that K63-linked and linear chains have in NF-kappaB activation. Future directions for linear polyubiquitin research are also discussed.},

abstract = {CARMA1 (also known as CARD11) is a scaffold molecule and contains a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and a membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like (MAGUK) domain. It plays an essential role in mediating CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-kappaB activation. However, the molecular mechanism by which CARMA1 mediates costimulatory signals remains to be determined. Here, we show that CARMA1 is constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. This membrane association is essential for the function of CARMA1, since a mutant of CARMA1, CARMA1(L808P), that is defective in the membrane association cannot rescue CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-kappaB activation in JPM50.6 CARMA1-deficient T cells. Although CD3/CD28 costimulation effectively induces the formation of the immunological synapse in CARMA1-deficient T cells, the recruitment of protein kinase C-theta (PKC-theta), Bcl10, and IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) into lipid rafts of the immunological synapse is defective. Moreover, expression of wild-type CARMA1, but not CARMA1(L808P), restores the recruitment of PKC-theta, Bcl10, and IKKbeta into lipid rafts in CARMA1-deficient T cells. Consistently, expression of a mutant CARMA1, CARMA1(DeltaCD), that cannot associate with Bcl10 failed to restore CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-kappaB activation in JPM50.6 cells, whereas expression of Bcl10-CARMA(DeltaCD) fusion protein effectively restored this NF-kappaB activation. Together, these results indicate that CARMA1 mediates CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-kappaB activation by recruiting downstream signaling components into the immunological synapse.},

abstract = {The NF-kappaB family of transcription factors is activated in response to many stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, environmental stresses and, in the case of B and T lymphocytes, by antigenic stimulation. Bcl10 is essential for NF-kappaB activation by T- and B-cell receptors. T and B lymphocytes from Bcl10-deficient mice fail to activate NF-kappaB in response to antigen-receptor stimulation and, as a consequence, are unable to proliferate. Bcl10 overexpression is sufficient to activate NF-kappaB, a process that requires the NF-kappaB essential modulator NEMO (also known as IKK-gamma), which is the regulatory subunit of the IkappaB kinase complex. However, the cellular mechanism by which Bcl10 activates the NF-kappaB pathway remains unclear. Here we show that Bcl10 targets NEMO for lysine-63-linked ubiquitination. Notably, a mutant form of NEMO that cannot be ubiquitinated inhibited Bcl10-induced NF-kappaB activation. Paracaspase and a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC13) were both required for Bcl10-induced NEMO ubiquitination and subsequent NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, short interfering RNAs that reduced the expression of paracaspase and UBC13 abrogated the effects of Bcl10. Thus, the adaptor protein Bcl10 promotes activation of NF-kappaB transcription factors through paracaspase- and UBC13-dependent ubiquitination of NEMO.},

Antigen-induced phosphorylation of Bcl10 has been reported, but its physiological function is unknown. Here we show that the putative downstream kinase IKKbeta is required for initial CBM complex formation. Further, upon engagement of IKKbeta/Malt1/Bcl10 with Carma1, IKKbeta phosphorylates Bcl10 in the C terminus and thereby interferes with Bcl10/Malt1 association and Bcl10-mediated IKKgamma ubiquitination. Mutation of the IKKbeta phosphorylation sites on Bcl10 enhances expression of NF-kappaB target genes IL-2 and TNFalpha after activation of primary T cells. Thus, our data provide evidence that IKKbeta serves a dual role upstream of its classical substrates, the IkappaB proteins. While being essential for triggering initial CBM complex formation, IKKbeta-dependent phosphorylation of Bcl10 exhibits a negative regulatory role in T cell activation.},

abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory tract infections in infants, but an effective vaccine has not yet been developed. An ideal vaccine would elicit protective antibodies while avoiding virus-specific T-cell responses, which have been implicated in vaccine-enhanced disease with previous RSV vaccines. We propose that heterologous proteins designed to present RSV-neutralizing antibody epitopes and to elicit cognate antibodies have the potential to fulfill these vaccine requirements, as they can be fashioned to be free of viral T-cell epitopes. Here we present the design and characterization of three epitope-scaffolds that present the epitope of motavizumab, a potent neutralizing antibody that binds to a helix-loop-helix motif in the RSV fusion glycoprotein. Two of the epitope-scaffolds could be purified, and one epitope-scaffold based on a Staphylococcus aureus protein A domain bound motavizumab with kinetic and thermodynamic properties consistent with the free epitope-scaffold being stabilized in a conformation that closely resembled the motavizumab-bound state. This epitope-scaffold was well folded as assessed by circular dichroism and isothermal titration calorimetry, and its crystal structure (determined in complex with motavizumab to 1.9 {\AA} resolution) was similar to the computationally designed model, with all hydrogen-bond interactions critical for binding to motavizumab preserved. Immunization of mice with this epitope-scaffold failed to elicit neutralizing antibodies but did elicit sera with F binding activity. The elicitation of F binding antibodies suggests that some of the design criteria for eliciting protective antibodies without virus-specific T-cell responses are being met, but additional optimization of these novel immunogens is required.},

A wide variety of signals emanating from antigen receptors, pattern-recognition receptors, receptors for the members of TNF and IL-1 cytokine families, and others induce differential activation of NF-kappaB heterodimers. Although work over the past two decades has shed significant light on the regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factors and their functions, much progress has been made in the past two years revealing new insights into the regulation and functions of NF-kappaB. This recent progress is covered in this review.},

abstract = {Computational protein design has promise for vaccine design and other applications. We previously transplanted the HIV 4E10 epitope onto non-HIV protein scaffolds for structural stabilization and immune presentation. Here, we developed two methods to optimize the structure of an antigen, flexible backbone remodeling and resurfacing, and we applied these methods to a 4E10 scaffold. In flexible-backbone remodeling, an existing backbone segment is replaced by a de novo designed segment of prespecified length and secondary structure. With remodeling, we replaced a potentially immunodominant domain on the scaffold with a helix-loop segment that made intimate contact to the protein core. All three domain trim designs tested experimentally had improved thermal stability and similar binding affinity for the 4E10 antibody compared to the parent scaffold. A crystal structure of one design had a 0.8 {\AA} backbone RMSD to the computational model in the rebuilt region. Comparison of parent and trimmed scaffold reactivity to anti-parent sera confirmed the deletion of an immunodominant domain. In resurfacing, the surface of an antigen outside a target epitope is redesigned to obtain variants that maintain only the target epitope. Resurfaced variants of two scaffolds were designed in which 50 positions amounting to 40% of the protein sequences were mutated. Surface-patch analyses indicated that most potential antibody footprints outside the 4E10 epitope were altered. The resurfaced variants maintained thermal stability and binding affinity. These results indicate that flexible-backbone remodeling and resurfacing are useful tools for antigen optimization and protein engineering generally.},

abstract = {NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) is a collective name for inducible dimeric transcription factors composed of members of the Rel family of DNA-binding proteins that recognize a common sequence motif. NF-kappaB is found in essentially all cell types and is involved in activation of an exceptionally large number of genes in response to infections, inflammation, and other stressful situations requiring rapid reprogramming of gene expression. NF-kappaB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells and consequently must be translocated into the nucleus to function. The subcellular location of NF-kappaB is controlled by a family of inhibitory proteins, IkappaBs, which bind NF-kappaB and mask its nuclear localization signal, thereby preventing nuclear uptake. Exposure of cells to a variety of extracellular stimuli leads to the rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ultimately proteolytic degradation of IkappaB, which frees NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus where it regulates gene transcription. NF-kappaB activation represents a paradigm for controlling the function of a regulatory protein via ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis, as an integral part of a phosphorylationbased signaling cascade. Recently, considerable progress has been made in understanding the details of the signaling pathways that regulate NF-kappaB activity, particularly those responding to the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1. The multisubunit IkappaB kinase (IKK) responsible for inducible IkappaB phosphorylation is the point of convergence for most NF-kappaB-activating stimuli. IKK contains two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, both of which are able to correctly phosphorylate IkappaB. Gene knockout studies have shed light on the very different physiological functions of IKKalpha and IKKbeta. After phosphorylation, the IKK phosphoacceptor sites on IkappaB serve as an essential part of a specific recognition site for E3RS(IkappaB/beta-TrCP), an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby explaining how IKK controls IkappaB ubiquitination and degradation. A variety of other signaling events, including phosphorylation of NF-kappaB, hyperphosphorylation of IKK, induction of IkappaB synthesis, and the processing of NF-kappaB precursors, provide additional mechanisms that modulate the level and duration of NF-kappaB activity.},

Signals through the pre-BCR are required for initiating diverse processes in pre-B cells, including proliferation and recombination of the light chain gene, which eventually lead to the differentiation of pre-B cells to immature B cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the pre-BCR promotes these processes remain largely unresolved. Recent findings suggest that forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors connect pre-BCR signalling to the activation of the recombination machinery. In this Review, we discuss how FOXO transcription factors are regulated by the pre-BCR to allow the progression of the cell cycle and the recombination of the light chain gene.},

abstract = {To probe the factors controlling immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement, we analyzed Abelson virus-transformed pre-B-cell lines that fail to undergo VH-to-DJH joining at an appreciable frequency. Despite this feature, some of these cell lines (rechi) rearrange an extrachromosomal recombination substrate at levels normal for transformed pre-B cells. Others (reclo) rearrange these substrates at levels characteristic of nonlymphoid hematopoietic cells. The DJH rearrangements from a representative rechi cell line were aberrant, suggesting that these cells probably fail to complete heavy-chain gene assembly because some of the necessary cis-acting signals are missing. In contrast, both DJH rearrangements from a reclo cell line appeared normal in structure, indicating that trans-acting factors necessary for recombination might be missing. Introduction of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes, genes encoding two such factors, failed to confer a rechi phenotype to these cells. However, fusion of the reclo cells to a rechi cell line generated a high frequency of rechi hybrids. In addition, most of the hybrids rearranged the endogenous kappa light-chain locus. Neither the rechi phenotype nor kappa-chain rearrangement correlated with levels of RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression in all of the hybrids. Thus, both gene transfer and cell fusion experiments indicate that RAG-1 and RAG-2 are not sufficient to activate immunoglobulin gene recombination in at least some pre-B-cell lines. In addition, the fusion experiments suggest that two gene products in addition to RAG-1 and RAG-2 may be required for kappa-gene rearrangement.},

abstract = {B cells, being a source of characteristic antinuclear autoantibodies, play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Evidences indicate that alterations in B-cell regulation are responsible for B-cell hyperactivity as seen in SLE. T cells, soluble factors, and even B cells themselves regulate effector B-cell functions. The latter, so-called regulatory B cells possess regulatory function through production of the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) that can damp down the humoral immune responses. This review will focus on B-cell regulation in the pathogenesis of SLE as a target for intervention. In particular, the regulatory impact of T cells through costimulation, soluble factors such as B lymphocyte stimulator, and the characteristics of IL 10-producing regulatory B cells will be discussed. Therapies targeting B cells as well as B-cell regulation seem promising, but the precise mechanisms involved in these interventions are not completely understood. More insight into B-cell regulation in SLE, and particularly in regulatory B cells, could lead to novel therapeutic strategies.},

Although many vaccine candidates have shown promising results in animal models, they have failed to be effective in human trials. In this study, a humanized mouse strain was evaluated as a potential preclinical model for studying human immune responses to HSV-2 infection and vaccination. Immunodeficient mouse strains were examined for their abilities to develop human innate and adaptive immune cells after transplantation of human umbilical cord stem cells. A RAG2(-/-) gammac(-/-) mouse strain with a BALB/c background was chosen as the most appropriate model and was then examined for its ability to mount innate and adaptive immune responses to intravaginal HSV-2 infection and immunization. After primary infection, human cells in the lymph nodes were able to generate a protective innate immune response and produce gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). After intravaginal immunization and infection, human T cells and NK cells were found in the genital tract and iliac lymph nodes. In addition, human T cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and vaginal tract were able to respond to stimulation with HSV-2 antigens by replicating and producing IFN-gamma. Human B cells were also able to produce HSV-2-specific immunoglobulin G. These adaptive responses were also shown to be protective and reduce local viral replication in the genital tract. This approach provides a means for studying human immune responses in vivo using a small-animal model and may become an important preclinical tool.},

abstract = {Natural killer (NK) cells are stimulated by ligands on virus-infected cells. We have recently demonstrated that NK cells respond to human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected autologous T-cells, in part, through the recognition of ligands for the NK cell activating receptor NKG2D on the surface of the infected cells. Uninfected primary CD4(pos) T-cell blasts express little, if any, NKG2D ligands. In the present study we determined the mechanism through which ligands for NKG2D are induced on HIV-1-infected cells. Our studies reveal that expression of vpr is necessary and sufficient to elicit the expression of NKG2D ligands in the context of HIV-1 infection. Vpr specifically induces surface expression of the unique-long 16 binding proteins (ULBP)-1 and ULBP-2, but not ULBP-3, MHC class I-related chain molecules (MIC)-A or MIC-B. In these studies we also demonstrated that Vpr increases the level of ULBP-1 and ULBP-2 mRNA in primary CD4(pos) T-cell blasts. The presence of ULBP-1 and ULBP-2 on HIV-1 infected cells is dependent on the ability of Vpr to associate with a protein complex know as Cullin 4a (Cul4a)/damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1) and Cul4a-associated factor-1(DCAF-1) E3 ubiquitin ligase (Cul4a(DCAF-1)). ULBP-1 and -2 expression by Vpr is also dependent on activation of the DNA damage sensor, ataxia telangiectasia and rad-3-related kinase (ATR). When T-cell blasts are infected with a vpr-deficient HIV-1, NK cells are impaired in killing the infected cells. Thus, HIV-1 Vpr actively triggers the expression of the ligands to the NK cell activation receptor.},

abstract = {B-cell intrinsic immunoglobulin class switch recombination (Ig-CSR) deficiencies, previously termed hyper-IgM syndromes, are genetically determined conditions characterized by normal or elevated serum IgM levels and an absence or very low levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE. As a function of the molecular mechanism, the defective CSR is variably associated to a defect in the generation of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) in the Ig variable region. The study of Ig-CSR deficiencies contributed to a better delineation of the mechanisms underlying CSR and SHM, the major events of antigen-triggered antibody maturation. Four Ig-CSR deficiency phenotypes have been so far reported: the description of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deficiency (Ig-CSR deficiency 1), caused by recessive mutations of AICDA gene, characterized by a defect in CSR and SHM, clearly established the role of AID in the induction of the Ig gene rearrangements underlying CSR and SHM. A CSR-specific function of AID has, however, been detected by the observation of a selective CSR defect caused by mutations affecting the C-terminus of AID. Ig-CSR deficiency 2 is the consequence of uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) deficiency. Because UNG, a molecule of the base excision repair machinery, removes uracils from DNA and AID deaminates cytosines into uracils, that observation indicates that the AID-UNG pathway directly targets DNA of switch regions from the Ig heavy-chain locus to induce the CSR process. Ig-CSR deficiencies 3 and 4 are characterized by a selective CSR defect resulting from blocks at distinct steps of CSR. A further understanding of the CSR machinery is expected from their molecular definition.},

Starting from random sequences, low free energy sequences were generated for 108 protein backbone structures by using a Monte Carlo optimization procedure and a free energy function based primarily on Lennard-Jones packing interactions and the Lazaridis-Karplus implicit solvation model. Remarkably, in the designed sequences 51% of the core residues and 27% of all residues were identical to the amino acids in the corresponding positions in the native sequences. The lowest free energy sequences obtained for ensembles of native-like backbone structures were also similar to the native sequence. Furthermore, both the individual residue frequencies and the covariances between pairs of positions observed in the very large SH3 domain family were recapitulated in core sequences designed for SH3 domain structures. Taken together, these results suggest that the volume of sequence space optimal for a protein structure is surprisingly restricted to a region around the native sequence.},

abstract = {Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) or neutrophils have multiple systems available for killing ingested bacteria. Nearly each of these incorporates H2O2 indicating the essential nature of this reactive oxygen intermediate for microbicidal activity. Following ingestion of bacteria by PMN, H2O2 is formed by the respiratory burst which consumes O2 and generates H2O2 from O2 .-. H2O2 is deposited intracellularly near bacteria within phagocytic vacuoles where it can react with the MPO-H2O2-halide system to form toxic hyperchlorous acid (HOCl) and/or possibly singlet oxygen (1O2). H2O2 can also react with O2 .- and/or iron (Fe++) from lactoferrin or bacteria to form the highly toxic hydroxyl radical (.OH). These mechanisms appear important since deficiencies of H2O2 production, myeloperoxidase or lactoferrin frequently increases their owner's susceptibility to infection. In particular, examination of PMN from infection prone patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) most clearly demonstrates the importance of H2O2 in killing of bacteria. CGD PMN lack the capacity to effectively generate H2O2 and subsequently have impaired ability to kill catalase positive (H2O2 producing) but not catalase negative (not H2O2 producing) bacteria. PMN also have catalase and glutathione peroxidase systems in their cytoplasms to protect themselves from the toxicity of H2O2. Finally, while H2O2 is critical for host defense, it can also be released extracellularly and thereby play a significant role in PMN mediated tissue injury.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW:We review structural information on the native HIV envelope trimer and the known epitopes for broadly neutralizing antibodies and discuss how this structural information should guide the design of more effective immunogens.

RECENT FINDINGS:Recent epitope mapping of HIV-positive sera demonstrates that the immune system is able to mount a potent and broadly neutralizing antibody response against conserved elements of the HIV envelope. The structure of trimeric envelope spikes on intact HIV-1 virions (the target of neutralizing antibodies) was determined at low resolution using cryo-electron tomography. Fitting high-resolution crystal structures of monomeric gp120 complexed with different neutralizing ligands into the cryo-electron density maps provides useful models for the native virion trimer and for mechanisms of neutralization.

SUMMARY:So far, all attempts to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV by immunization have failed. Recent structural information on the virion-associated HIV envelope spike and of the precise interaction of broadly neutralizing mAbs with their epitopes clarifies the steric and geometric constraints faced by antibodies targeting conserved HIV epitopes. Implications for vaccine design are discussed.},

abstract = {The primary function of neutrophils in host defense is to contain and eradicate invading microbial pathogens. This is achieved through a series of swift and highly coordinated responses culminating in ingestion (phagocytosis) and killing of invading microbes. While these tasks are usually performed without injury to host tissues, in pathologic circumstances such as sepsis, potent antimicrobial compounds can be released extracellularly, inducing a spectrum of responses in host cells ranging from activation to injury and death. In the lung, such inflammatory damage is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of diverse lung diseases, including acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive lung disease, and cystic fibrosis. In these disorders, epithelial cells are targets of leukocyte-derived antimicrobial products, including proteinases and oxidants. Herein, we review the mechanisms involved in the physiologic process of neutrophil transepithelial migration, including the role of specific adhesion molecules on the leukocyte and epithelial cells. We examine the responses of the epithelial cells to the itinerant leukocytes and their cytotoxic products and the consequences of this for lung injury and repair. This paradigm has important clinical implications because of the potential for selective blockade of these pathways to prevent or attenuate lung injury.},

These studies lead to the description of the Ku-DNA-dependent protein kinase complex and the XRCC4 factor. A human SCID condition is characterized by an absence of B and T lymphocytes. One subset of these patients also demonstrates an increased sensitivity to the ionizing radiation of their fibroblasts and bone marrow precursor cells. This phenotype is accompanied by a profound defect in V(D)J recombination with a lack of coding joint formation, whereas signal joints are normal. Functional and genetic analyses distinguish these patients from the other recombination/repair mutants, and thus define a new group of mutants whose affected gene(s) is involved in sensitivity to ionizing radiation and V(D)J recombination.},

To understand the basis of this resistance, we determined co-crystal structures for two poorly neutralizing, CD4-binding site (CD4BS) antibodies, F105 and b13, in complexes with gp120. Both antibodies exhibited approach angles to gp120 similar to those of CD4 and a rare, broadly neutralizing CD4BS antibody, b12. Slight differences in recognition, however, resulted in substantial differences in F105- and b13-bound conformations relative to b12-bound gp120. Modeling and binding experiments revealed these conformations to be poorly compatible with the viral spike. This incompatibility, the consequence of slight differences in CD4BS recognition, renders HIV-1 resistant to all but the most accurately targeted antibodies.},

abstract = {The limited size of the germline antibody repertoire has to recognize a far larger number of potential antigens. The ability of a single antibody to bind multiple ligands due to conformational flexibility in the antigen-binding site can significantly enlarge the repertoire. Among the six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that generally comprise the binding site, the CDR H3 loop is particularly variable. Computational protein design studies showed that predicted low energy sequences compatible with a given backbone structure often have considerable similarity to the corresponding native sequences of naturally occurring proteins, indicating that native protein sequences are close to optimal for their structures. Here, we take a step forward to determine whether conformational flexibility, believed to play a key functional role in germline antibodies, is also central in shaping their native sequence. In particular, we use a multi-constraint computational design strategy, along with the Rosetta scoring function, to propose that the native sequences of CDR H3 loops from germline antibodies are nearly optimal for conformational flexibility. Moreover, we find that antibody maturation may lead to sequences with a higher degree of optimization for a single conformation, while disfavoring sequences that are intrinsically flexible. In addition, this computational strategy allows us to predict mutations in the CDR H3 loop to stabilize the antigen-bound conformation, a computational mimic of affinity maturation, that may increase antigen binding affinity by preorganizing the antigen binding loop. In vivo affinity maturation data are consistent with our predictions. The method described here can be useful to design antibodies with higher selectivity and affinity by reducing conformational diversity.},

Conservation is particularly noted among the VH3-like sequences of all jawed vertebrates in the FR2 and FR3 segments, as well as in the FGXGT(R or K)L J-segment characteristic of light chains and TCRs and the WGXGT(uncharged)VT JH segments. Human VH3-53 and Vlambda6 family orthologs may be present over the entire range of vertebrates. Models of the three-dimensional structures of shark VH/VL combining sites indicate similarity in framework structure and comparable CDR usage to those of man. Although carcharhine shark VH regions show greater than 50% identity to the human VH germline prototype, searches of lower deuterostome and invertebrate databases fail to detect molecules with significant relatedness. Overall, antibodies of jawed vertebrates show tremendous individual diversity, but are constructed incorporating design features that arose with the evolutionary emergence of the jawed vertebrates and have been conserved through at least 450 million years of evolutionary time.},

abstract = {The immunoglobulin repertoire arises as a consequence of combinatorial diversity, junctional diversity, and the process of somatic point mutation. Each of these processes involves biases that limit and shape the available immunoglobulin repertoire. The expressed repertoire is further shaped by selection, to the extent that biased gene usage can become apparent in many disease states. The study of rearranged immunoglobulin genes therefore may not only provide insights into the molecular processes involved in the generation of antibody diversity but also inform us of pathogenic processes and perhaps identify particular lymphocyte clones as therapeutic targets. Partly as a consequence of the low numbers of circulating IgE-committed B-cells, studies of rearranged IgE genes in allergic individuals have commenced relatively recently. In this review, recent advances in our understanding of the processes of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and somatic point mutation are described, and biases inherent to these processes are discussed. The evidence that some diseases may be associated with particular gene rearrangements is then considered, with a particular focus on allergic disease. Reviewed data suggest that an important contribution to the IgE response may come from cells that use relatively rare heavy chain V (V(H)) segment genes, which display little somatic point mutation. Some IgE antibodies also seem to display polyreactive binding. In other contexts, these 3 characteristics have been associated with antibodies of the B-1 B-cell subset, and the possibility that B-1 B-cells contribute to the allergic response is therefore considered.},

abstract = {Swine share with most placental mammals the same five antibody isotypes and same two light chain types. Loci encoding lambda, kappa and Ig heavy chains appear to be organized as they are in other mammals. Swine differ from rodents and primates, but are similar to rabbits in using a single VH family (VH3) to encode their variable heavy chain domain, but not the family used by cattle, another artiodactyl. Distinct from other hoofed mammals and rodents, Ckappa:Clambda usage resembles the 1:1 ratio seen in primates. Since IgG subclasses diversified after speciation, same name subclass homologs do not exist among swine and other mammals unless very closely related. Swine possess six putative IgG subclasses that appear to have diversified by gene duplication and exon shuffle while retaining motifs that can bind to FcgammaRs, FcRn, C1q, protein A and protein G. The epithelial chorial placenta of swine and the precosial nature of their offspring have made piglets excellent models for studies on fetal antibody repertoire development and on the postnatal role of gut colonization, maternal colostrum and neonatal infection on the development of adaptive immunity during the "critical window" of immunological development. This chapter traces the study of the humoral immune system of this species through its various eras of discovery and compiles the results in tables and figures that should be a useful reference for educators and investigators.},

abstract = {The genes that encode immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors must be assembled from the multiple variable (V), joining (J), and sometimes diversity (D) gene segments present in the germline loci. This process of V(D)J recombination is the major source of the immense diversity of the immune repertoire of jawed vertebrates. The recombinase that initiates the process, recombination-activating genes 1 (RAG1) and RAG2, belongs to a large family that includes transposases and retroviral integrases. RAG1/2 cleaves the DNA adjacent to the gene segments to be recombined, and the segments are then joined together by DNA repair factors. A decade of biochemical research on RAG1/2 has revealed many similarities to transposition, culminating with the observation that RAG1/2 can carry out transpositional strand transfer. Here, we discuss the parallels between V(D)J recombination and transposition, focusing specifically on the assembly of the recombination nucleoprotein complex, the mechanism of cleavage, the disassembly of post-cleavage complexes, and aberrant reactions carried out by the recombinase that do not result in successful locus rearrangement and may be deleterious to the organism. This work highlights the considerable diversity of transposition systems and their relation to V(D)J recombination.},

abstract = {Most vertebrate species utilize antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes to create a vast repertoire of antigen sensor molecules on their B and T lymphocytes, respectively. While the organization of these genes exhibits substantial variation between species, one common theme is that, in almost every case, there is at least one variable region with a highly diverse CDR3 region and often much less diversity elsewhere in the binding site. Whereas with alphabeta TCRs this skewing of diversity correlates well with the need to recognize diverse peptides bound to MHC molecules, this cannot explain why this same pattern is evident in immunoglobulins (Igs) or gammadelta TCRs. Instead we have postulated that in the primary repertoire, all or most antigen receptors have a bipartite binding site, in which diverse CDR3 loops act as a highly antigen specific 'core' whereas other CDRs bind in a largely opportunistic fashion. In the case of antibodies, somatic hypermutation then acts to improve the complementarity to a given antigen and increase antibody affinity. A test of this model in mice engineered to have a very limited V region repertoire shows that primary antibodies can be generated that are highly specific for distinct antigens, yet identical in sequence except for their V(H) CDR3. Furthermore, very high affinity antibodies can be raised by repeated immunizations, showing that somatic hypermutation can mold these low affinity antibodies into high affinity ones. Thus, the wide variations seen in V region repertoires amongst vertebrates is likely to be of lesser importance than the preservation of one or more diverse CDR3 regions.},

To determine if non-stochastic utilization was a generally applicable rule, the identities of rearranged V region gene segments were determined in unselected peripheral blood B cells from 12 subjects (five male, seven female), ranging in age from 35 to 72 years. The analysis was limited to V region genes belonging to the VH3 gene family. More than 4500 independent VH3-containing rearrangements were analysed. The frequency of occurrence of eight individual VH3 gene segments contained in rearrangements was assessed using gene specific oligonucleotide probes. Usage of elements was not uniform. Three elements, which have been known to encode autoantibodies as well as to be frequently rearranged during fetal development, were represented among rearrangements more frequently than were other members of the VH3 family, and in aggregate, accounted for the majority of rearrangements. These three predominant loci are clustered in an 80 kb region suggesting an influence of chromosomal location on efficiency of rearrangement. The results document a clear, statistically significant, preference for the occurrence of specific V region genes among rearrangements. The modest amount of variation observed between subjects was not associated with either age or gender. Duplications which increased gene dose may have contributed to increased gene usage. These data indicate that, in caucasians, the immunoglobulin rearrangements in adult human B cells are dominated by a few heavy chain V region genes to the exclusion of other putatively equally functional genes. Thus, the conventional notion that the adult repertoire is normalized with respect to family complexity is not confirmed by analysis of individual VH genes.},

The dynamics of antibody repertoires among adults over a longer period of time in one and the same individual has, however, not been extensively studied. In this study we analysed peripheral blood samples from five healthy adults, taken over a period of 10 weeks and once 9 years later. A competitive, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed to investigate short and long-term variations in VH gene family repertoires. Serum antibody levels to common self and non-self antigens were determined in samples taken at the same time-points as the cell samples to analyse possible correlations between molecular and serological expression profiles. We found a high degree of stability in the VH gene family repertoire over time as well as between individuals with a Caucasian background. A specific change in the usage of primarily the VH3 and VH5 gene families was observed in one individual at one time-point. The deviating pattern resembled the VH gene family utilization pattern observed in naturally activated B lymphocytes. The fluctuations in VH3 and VH5 gene family expression correlated with the presence of rheumatoid factor in serum. We discuss the possible influence of polyclonal, transient stimulation of B cells on VH gene repertoires, as measured in circulating B cells.},

Furthermore, we found that dominance of the VH1-46 gene segment was a prominent feature in the VH gene repertoire of RV VP6-specific naive B cells, but this dominance was reduced in memory B cells. Increased diversity in the VH gene repertoire of the two memory B cell groups derived from broader usage of VH gene segments, increased junctional diversity that was introduced by differential TdT activities, and somatic hypermutation.},

abstract = {B cells of the largest Ig variable heavy chain gene (VH) family, VH3, are reportedly decreased in patients with late stage HIV-1 disease. This deficit may contribute to their impaired responses to infections and vaccines. We confirmed that the VH3 family was underrepresented in serum IgM proteins, with a 45% decrease in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. However, the proportion of VH3 within VH(1-6) IgM mRNA from peripheral B cells did not differ from that of control subjects (mean +/- SD, 57.1 +/- 9.7 vs 61.1 +/- 8. 7%). Similarly, within VH(1-6) IgD mRNA, which even more closely represents the unstimulated naive repertoire, the relative expression of VH3 mRNA was comparable in the two groups. Moreover, the frequency of individual genes within the VH3 family for IgD, particularly genes which encode putative HIV-1 gp120 binding sites, also was normal in HIV-1-infected patients. However, VH3 family expression for IgG mRNA was significantly decreased (17%) and VH4 IgG was increased (33%) relative to other VH families in advanced HIV-1-infected patients. Thus, the changes in VH family expression were more readily apparent in previously activated IgG "memory" B cell populations and, likely, in cells actively producing IgM rather than in resting naive cells. The presence of a relatively normal naive VH3 IgM and IgD mRNA repertoire in resting cells supports the prospect that with proper stimulation, particularly in conjunction with effective antiviral therapy, vigorous humoral immune responses to infections and vaccines may be elicited in this high-risk population.},

A subpopulation of normal B cells from non-HIV-infected individuals was shown to bind to HIV gp120 by means of membrane Ig; most of these B cells expressed VH3 family Ig. Serum VH3 IgM from uninfected individuals also avidly bound gp120.

abstract = {Somatic hypermutation plays an essential role in avidity maturation of Ab. To characterize the effects of hypermutation without the imposed bias of Ag-mediated selection, the mutational pattern of 37 nonproductively rearranged VH genes amplified from individual human B cells was analyzed. A high frequency of mutations as well as frequent replacement mutations were observed in the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) and in the framework regions of nonproductive VHDJH rearrangements. Comparison with 57 productive VH rearrangements indicated that replacement mutations, especially those occurring in the framework regions, were less frequent in productively rearranged VH genes, suggesting that they were deleted from the expressed repertoire. A number of factors contributed to the nonrandom localization of mutations, including: the targeting of specific motifs, such as AGY, GCY, GTA, TAY, and RGYW; an increased frequency of some commonly mutated motifs in the CDRs; and an apparent increased likelihood of mutations of CDR nucleotides. Each of these appeared to bias the mutational machinery, resulting in an increased frequency of replacement mutations in the CDRs of nonproductive VH rearrangements.},

abstract = {Ab repertoires exhibit marked restrictions during fetal life characterized by biases of variable gene usage and lack of junctional diversity. We tested the hypothesis that Ab repertoire restriction contributes to the observed poor quality of specific Ab responses made by infants to viral infections. We analyzed the molecular determinants of B cell responses in humans to two Ags of rotavirus (RV), a common and clinically important infection of human infants. We sequenced Ab H and L chain V region genes (V(H) and V(L)) of clones expanded from single B cells responding to RV virus protein 6 or virus protein 7. We found that adults exhibited a distinct bias in use of gene segments in the V(H)1 and V(H)4 families, for example, V(H)1-46, V(H)4-31, and V(H)4-61. This gene segment bias differed markedly from the V(H)3 dominant bias seen in randomly selected adult B cells. Recombinant Abs incorporating any of those three immunodominant V(H) segments bound to RV-infected cells and also to purified RV particles. The RV-specific B cell repertoires of infants aged 2-11 mo and those of adults were highly related when compared by V(H), D, J(H), V(L), and J(L) segment selection, extent of junctional diversity, and mean H chain complementarity determining region 3 length. These data suggest that residual fetal bias of the B cell repertoire is not a limiting determinant of the quality of Ab responses to viruses of infants beyond the neonatal period.},

abstract = {CD4 is present on the surface of T-lymphocytes and is the primary cellular receptor for HIV-1. CD4 consists of a cytoplasmic tail, one transmembrane region, and four extracellular domains, D1-D4. A construct consisting of the first two domains of CD4 (CD4D12) is folded and binds gp120 with similar affinity as soluble 4-domain CD4 (sCD4). However, the first domain alone (CD4D1) was previously shown to be largely unfolded and had 3-fold weaker affinity for gp120 when compared to sCD4 [Sharma, D.; et al. (2005) Biochemistry 44, 16192-16202]. We now report the design and characterization of three single-site mutants of CD4D12 (G6A, L51I, and V86L) and one multisite mutant of CD4D1 (G6A/L51I/L5K/F98T). G6A, L51I, and V86L are cavity-filling mutations while L5K and F98T are surface mutations which were introduced to minimize the aggregation of CD4D1 upon removal of the second domain. Two mutations, G6A and V86L in CD4D12 increased the stability and yield of the protein relative to the wild-type protein. The mutant CD4D1 (CD4D1a) with the 4 mutations was folded and more stable compared to the original CD4D1, but both bound gp120 with comparable affinity. In in vitro neutralization assays, both CD4D1a and G6A-CD4D12 were able to neutralize diverse HIV-1 viruses with similar IC(50)s as 4-domain CD4. These stabilized derivatives of human CD4 can be useful starting points for the design of other more complex viral entry inhibitors.},

abstract = {Here we have identified HIV-1 B clade Envelope (Env) amino acid signatures from early in infection that may be favored at transmission, as well as patterns of recurrent mutation in chronic infection that may reflect common pathways of immune evasion. To accomplish this, we compared thousands of sequences derived by single genome amplification from several hundred individuals that were sampled either early in infection or were chronically infected. Samples were divided at the outset into hypothesis-forming and validation sets, and we used phylogenetically corrected statistical strategies to identify signatures, systematically scanning all of Env. Signatures included single amino acids, glycosylation motifs, and multi-site patterns based on functional or structural groupings of amino acids. We identified signatures near the CCR5 co-receptor-binding region, near the CD4 binding site, and in the signal peptide and cytoplasmic domain, which may influence Env expression and processing. Two signatures patterns associated with transmission were particularly interesting. The first was the most statistically robust signature, located in position 12 in the signal peptide. The second was the loss of an N-linked glycosylation site at positions 413-415; the presence of this site has been recently found to be associated with escape from potent and broad neutralizing antibodies, consistent with enabling a common pathway for immune escape during chronic infection. Its recurrent loss in early infection suggests it may impact fitness at the time of transmission or during early viral expansion. The signature patterns we identified implicate Env expression levels in selection at viral transmission or in early expansion, and suggest that immune evasion patterns that recur in many individuals during chronic infection when antibodies are present can be selected against when the infection is being established prior to the adaptive immune response.},

abstract = {An effective HIV-1 vaccine should ideally induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses that provide sterilizing immunity over a prolonged period. Current HIV-1 vaccines have failed in inducing such immunity. The viral envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) can be targeted by neutralizing antibodies to block infection, but several Env properties limit the ability to induce an antibody response of sufficient quantity and quality. We hypothesized that Env immunogenicity could be improved by embedding an immunostimulatory protein domain within its sequence. A stabilized Env trimer was therefore engineered with the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) inserted into the V1V2 domain of gp120. Probing with neutralizing antibodies showed that both the Env and GM-CSF components of the chimeric protein were folded correctly. Furthermore, the embedded GM-CSF domain was functional as a cytokine in vitro. Mouse immunization studies demonstrated that chimeric Env(GM-CSF) enhanced Env-specific antibody and T cell responses compared with wild-type Env. Collectively, these results show that targeting and activation of immune cells using engineered cytokine domains within the protein can improve the immunogenicity of Env subunit vaccines.},

abstract = {Complex N-glycans flank the receptor binding sites of the outer domain of HIV-1 gp120, ostensibly forming a protective "fence" against antibodies. Here, we investigated the effects of rebuilding this fence with smaller glycoforms by expressing HIV-1 pseudovirions from a primary isolate in a human cell line lacking N-acetylglucosamine transferase I (GnTI), the enzyme that initiates the conversion of oligomannose N-glycans into complex N-glycans. Thus, complex glycans, including those that surround the receptor binding sites, are replaced by fully trimmed oligomannose stumps. Conversely, the untrimmed oligomannoses of the silent domain of gp120 are likely to remain unchanged. For comparison, we produced a mutant virus lacking a complex N-glycan of the V3 loop (N301Q). Both variants exhibited increased sensitivities to V3 loop-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and soluble CD4. The N301Q virus was also sensitive to "nonneutralizing" MAbs targeting the primary and secondary receptor binding sites. Endoglycosidase H treatment resulted in the removal of outer domain glycans from the GnTI- but not the parent Env trimers, and this was associated with a rapid and complete loss in infectivity. Nevertheless, the glycan-depleted trimers could still bind to soluble receptor and coreceptor analogs, suggesting a block in post-receptor binding conformational changes necessary for fusion. Collectively, our data show that the antennae of complex N-glycans serve to protect the V3 loop and CD4 binding site, while N-glycan stems regulate native trimer conformation, such that their removal can lead to global changes in neutralization sensitivity and, in extreme cases, an inability to complete the conformational rearrangements necessary for infection.},

abstract = {The viral spike of HIV-1 is composed of three gp120 envelope glycoproteins attached noncovalently to three gp41 transmembrane molecules. Viral entry is initiated by binding to the CD4 receptor on the cell surface, which induces large conformational changes in gp120. These changes not only provide a model for receptor-triggered entry, but affect spike sensitivity to drug- and antibody-mediated neutralization. Although some of the details of the CD4-induced conformational change have been visualized by crystal structures and cryoelectron tomograms, the critical gp41-interactive region of gp120 was missing from previous atomic-level characterizations. Here we determine the crystal structure of an HIV-1 gp120 core with intact gp41-interactive region in its CD4-bound state, compare this structure to unliganded and antibody-bound forms to identify structurally invariant and plastic components, and use ligand-oriented cryoelectron tomograms to define component mobility in the viral spike context. Newly defined gp120 elements proximal to the gp41 interface complete a 7-stranded beta-sandwich, which appeared invariant in conformation. Loop excursions emanating from the sandwich form three topologically separate--and structurally plastic--layers, topped off by the highly glycosylated gp120 outer domain. Crystal structures, cryoelectron tomograms, and interlayer chemistry were consistent with a mechanism in which the layers act as a shape-changing spacer, facilitating movement between outer domain and gp41-associated beta-sandwich and providing for conformational diversity used in immune evasion. A "layered" gp120 architecture thus allows movement among alternative glycoprotein conformations required for virus entry and immune evasion, whereas a beta-sandwich clamp maintains gp120-gp41 interaction and regulates gp41 transitions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW:We summarize and discuss recent developments regarding the immunogenicity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) oligomers, focusing, for the most part, on trimeric, recombinant protein immunogens.

RECENT FINDINGS:The three-dimensional cryo-electron tomography images of the HIV-1 Env trimeric spike, coupled with previous data demonstrating the impact on envelope glycoprotein (gp120)-transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) cleavage of the architecture of the Env trimers, provide exciting information that may lead to new avenues for novel immunogen design. Through new processes to map region-specific anti-Env antibodies present in immune serum, it is now possible to define antibody specificities against conformationally sensitive surfaces of Env. A number of strategies designed to counteract the immunodominance of the HIV-1 Env variable regions were attempted, and a recent study demonstrates that immunization with Env trimers provides sterilizing protection against mucosal challenge with virus. Importantly, protection against the challenge virus was associated with in-vitro HIV-1 neutralization titers.

SUMMARY:Several studies within the past 18 months provide exciting structural information and the development of tools that have the potential to improve Env trimer design and the analysis of trimer immunogenicity studies. The ability to predict protection against a challenge virus through an in-vitro neutralization screen may be very helpful for evaluation of immunogens to move forward into clinical trials.},

abstract = {During exhalation, the surfactant film of lipids and proteins that coats the alveoli in the lung is compressed to high surface pressures, and can remain metastable for prolonged periods at pressures approaching 70 mN/m. Monolayers of calf lung surfactant extract (CLSE), however, collapse in vitro, during an initial compression at approximately 45 mN/m. To gain information on the source of this discrepancy, we investigated how monolayers of CLSE collapse from the interface. Observations with fluorescence, Brewster angle, and light scattering microscopies show that monolayers containing CLSE, CLSE-cholesterol (20%), or binary mixtures of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine(DPPC)-dihydrocholesterol all form bilayer disks that reside above the monolayer. Upon compression and expansion, lipids flow continuously from the monolayer into the disks, and vice versa. In several respects, the mode of collapse resembles the behavior of other amphiphiles that form smectic liquid-crystal phases. These findings suggest that components of surfactent films must collapse collectively rather than being squeezed out individually.},

abstract = {We describe predictions of the structures of CASP5 targets using Rosetta. The Rosetta fragment insertion protocol was used to generate models for entire target domains without detectable sequence similarity to a protein of known structure and to build long loop insertions (and N-and C-terminal extensions) in cases where a structural template was available. Encouraging results were obtained both for the de novo predictions and for the long loop insertions; we describe here the successes as well as the failures in the context of current efforts to improve the Rosetta method. In particular, de novo predictions failed for large proteins that were incorrectly parsed into domains and for topologically complex (high contact order) proteins with swapping of segments between domains. However, for the remaining targets, at least one of the five submitted models had a long fragment with significant similarity to the native structure. A fully automated version of the CASP5 protocol produced results that were comparable to the human-assisted predictions for most of the targets, suggesting that automated genomic-scale, de novo protein structure prediction may soon be worthwhile. For the three targets where the human-assisted predictions were significantly closer to the native structure, we identify the steps that remain to be automated.},

V. Joag, Z. Li, L. Foresman, E. B. Stephens, L.-J. Zhao, I. Adany, D. M. Pinson, H. M. McClure, and O. Narayan, J. Virol. 70:3189-3197, 1996). The env gene of the KU-1 virus was used to create a molecularly cloned virus, SHIV-HXBc2P 3.2, that differed from a nonpathogenic SHIV-HXBc2 virus in only 12 envelope glycoprotein residues. SHIV-HXBc2P 3.2 replicated efficiently and caused rapid and persistent CD4(+) T-lymphocyte depletion in inoculated rhesus macaques. Compared with the envelope glycoproteins of the parental SHIV-HXBc2, the SHIV-HXBc2P 3.2 envelope glycoproteins supported more efficient infection of rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both the parental SHIV-HXBc2 and the pathogenic SHIV-HXBc2P 3.2 used CXCR4 but none of the other seven transmembrane segment receptors tested as a second receptor. Compared with the parental virus, viruses with the SHIV-HXBc2P 3.2 envelope glycoproteins were more resistant to neutralization by soluble CD4 and antibodies. Thus, changes in the envelope glycoproteins account for the ability of the passaged virus to deplete CD4(+) T lymphocytes rapidly and specify increased replicative capacity and resistance to neutralization.},

abstract = {During human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, patients develop various levels of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. In some cases, patient sera can potently neutralize diverse strains of HIV-1, but the antibody specificities that mediate this broad neutralization are not known, and their elucidation remains a formidable challenge. Due to variable and nonneutralizing determinants on the exterior envelope glycoprotein (Env), nonnative Env protein released from cells, and the glycan shielding that assembles in the context of the quaternary structure of the functional spike, HIV-1 Env elicits a myriad of binding antibodies. However, few of these antibodies can neutralize circulating viruses. We present a systematic analysis of the NAb specificities of a panel of HIV-1-positive sera, using methodologies that identify both conformational and continuous neutralization determinants on the HIV-1 Env protein. Characterization of sera included selective adsorption with native gp120 and specific point mutant variants, chimeric virus analysis, and peptide inhibition of viral neutralization. The gp120 protein was the major neutralizing determinant for most sera, although not all neutralization activity against all viruses could be identified. In some broadly neutralizing sera, the gp120-directed neutralization mapped to the CD4 binding region of gp120. In addition, we found evidence that regions of the gp120 coreceptor binding site may also be a target of neutralizing activity. Sera displaying limited neutralization breadth were mapped to the immunogenic V3 region of gp120. In a subset of sera, we also identified NAbs directed against the conserved, membrane-proximal external region of gp41. These data allow a more detailed understanding of the humoral responses to the HIV-1 Env protein and provide insights regarding the most relevant targets for HIV-1 vaccine design.},

The HMM bit score of 8 is experimentally determined to be the threshold for discriminating signal sequences from non-secretory ones. An artificial SP-HMM generated signal sequence of the maximum model bit score (HMM + 38) was selected as an ideal human signal sequence.

We further ranked the signal strengths of the signal peptides of the known human secretory proteins by SP-HMM bit scores.

We test this hypothesis through addition of a knowledge-based, exposure-dependent energy term to the RosettaDesign solvation potential [Lazaridis, T., and Karplus, M. (1999) Proteins 35, 133-152]. Correlation between amino acid type and surface exposure is determined from a representative set of experimental protein structures. The amino acid solvent accessible surface area (SASA) is estimated with a neighbor vector measure that increases in accuracy compared to the neighbor count measure while remaining pairwise decomposable [Durham, E., et al.

Benchmarking of this potential in protein design displays a 3.2% improvement in the overall sequence recovery and an 8.5% improvement in recovery of amino acid types tolerated in evolution.},

abstract = {Here, we comment on the steadily increasing body of data showing that proteins with specificity actually bind ligands of diverse shapes, sizes, and composition. Such a phenomenon is not surprising when one considers that binding is a dynamic process with populations in equilibrium and that the shape of the binding site is strongly influenced by the molecular partner. It derives implicitly from the concept of populations. All proteins, specific and nonspecific, exist in ensembles of substates. If the library of ligands in solution is large enough, favorably matching ligands with altered shapes and sizes can be expected to bind, with a redistribution of the protein populations. Point mutations at spatially distant sites may exert large conformational rearrangements and hinge effects, consistent with mutations away from the binding site leading to population shifts and (cross-)drug resistance. A similar effect is observed in protein superfamilies, in which different sequences with similar topologies display similar large-scale dynamic motions. The hinges are frequently at analogous sites, yet with different substrate specificity. Similar topologies yield similar conformational isomers, although with different distributions of population times, owing to the change in the conditions, that is, the change in the sequences. In turn, different distributions relate to binding of different sizes and shapes. Hence, the binding site shape and size are defined by the ligand. They are not independent entities of fixed proportions and cannot be analyzed independently of the binding partner. Such a proposition derives from viewing proteins as dynamic distributions, presenting to the incoming ligands a range of binding site shapes. It illustrates how presumably specific binding molecules can bind multiple ligands. In terms of drug design, the ability of a single receptor to recognize many dissimilar ligands shows the need to consider more diverse molecules. It provides a rationale for higher affinity inhibitors that are not derived from substrates at their transition states and indicates flexible docking schemes.},

abstract = {Photon echo spectroscopy has been used to measure the response of three antibody-binding sites to perturbation from electronic excitation of a bound antigen, fluorescein. The three antibodies show motions that range in time scale from tens of femtoseconds to nanoseconds. Relative to the others, one antibody, 4-4-20, possesses a rigid binding site that likely results from a short and inflexible heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) loop and a critical Tyr that acts as a "molecular splint," rigidifying the antigen across its most flexible internal degree of freedom. The remaining two antibodies, 34F10 and 40G4, despite being generated against the same antigen, possess binding sites that are considerably more flexible. The more flexible combining sites likely result from longer HCDR3 loops and a deletion in the light chain complementarity-determining region 1 (LCDR1) that removes the critical Tyr residue. The binding site flexibilities may result in varying mechanisms of antigen recognition including lock-and-key, induced-fit, and conformational selection.},

The generation of a large and highly curated test set of pharmaceutically relevant protein-ligand complexes with known binding affinities is described, and three highly regarded docking programs (Glide, GOLD, and ICM) are evaluated on the same set with respect to their ability to reproduce crystallographic binding orientations. Glide correctly identified the crystallographic pose within 2.0 A in 61% of the cases, versus 48% for GOLD and 45% for ICM. In general Glide appears to perform most consistently with respect to diversity of binding sites and ligand flexibility, while the performance of ICM and GOLD is more binding site-dependent and it is significantly poorer when binding is predominantly driven by hydrophobic interactions. The results also show that energy minimization and reranking of the top N poses can be an effective means to overcome some of the limitations of a given docking function. The same docking programs are evaluated in conjunction with three different scoring functions for their ability to discriminate actives from inactives in virtual screening. The evaluation, performed on three different systems (HIV-1 protease, IMPDH, and p38 MAP kinase), confirms that the relative performance of different docking and scoring methods is to some extent binding site-dependent. GlideScore appears to be an effective scoring function for database screening, with consistent performance across several types of binding sites, while ChemScore appears to be most useful in sterically demanding sites since it is more forgiving of repulsive interactions. Energy minimization of docked poses can significantly improve the enrichments in systems with sterically demanding binding sites. Overall Glide appears to be a safe general choice for docking, while the choice of the best scoring tool remains to a larger extent system-dependent and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.},

abstract = {Site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL-EPR) is often used for the structural characterization of proteins that elude other techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). However, high-resolution structures are difficult to obtain due to uncertainty in the spin label location and sparseness of experimental data. Here, we introduce RosettaEPR, which has been designed to improve de novo high-resolution protein structure prediction using sparse SDSL-EPR distance data. The "motion-on-a-cone" spin label model is converted into a knowledge-based potential, which was implemented as a scoring term in Rosetta. RosettaEPR increased the fractions of correctly folded models ( [Formula: see text] <7.5{\AA}) and models accurate at medium resolution ( [Formula: see text] <3.5{\AA}) by 25%. The correlation of score and model quality increased from 0.42 when using no restraints to 0.51 when using bounded restraints and again to 0.62 when using RosettaEPR. This allowed for the selection of accurate models by score. After full-atom refinement, RosettaEPR yielded a 1.7{\AA} model of T4-lysozyme, thus indicating that atomic detail models can be achieved by combining sparse EPR data with Rosetta. While these results indicate RosettaEPR's potential utility in high-resolution protein structure prediction, they are based on a single example. In order to affirm the method's general performance, it must be tested on a larger and more versatile dataset of proteins.},

The de novo Rosetta algorithm predicts protein three-dimensional structures using only sequence information by combining short fragments selected from known protein structures on the basis of local sequence similarity. These fragments are assembled using a Monte Carlo strategy to generate models that reproduce empirical statistics describing nonlocal protein structure such as overall compactness, hydrophobic burial, and beta-strand pairing. By incorporating chemical shift, nuclear Overhauser enhancement, and?or residual dipolar coupling restraints that are insufficient on their own to determine the protein global fold, the RosettaNMR method correctly estimates the global fold of a variety of different proteins, generating models that are that are generally 4?A or better Calpha root-mean-square deviation to the high-resolution experimental structures. Here we review the capabilities of the RosettaNMR approach, describe the underlying methods, and provide practical tips for applying the technique to structure estimation problems.},

abstract = {We illustrate how moderate resolution protein structures can be rapidly obtained by interlinking computational prediction methodologies with un- or partially assigned NMR data. To facilitate the application of our recently described method of ranking and subsequent refining alternative structural models using unassigned NMR data [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100 (2003) 15404] for such "structural genomics"-type experiments it is combined with protein models from several prediction techniques, enhanced to utilize partial assignments, and applied on a protein with an unknown structure and fold. From the original NMR spectra obtained for the 140 residue fumarate sensor DcuS, 1100 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shift signals, 3000 1H-1H NOESY cross peak intensities, and 209 backbone residual dipolar couplings were extracted and used to rank models produced by de novo structure prediction and comparative modeling methods. The ranking proceeds in two steps: first, an optimal assignment of the NMR peaks to atoms is found for each model independently, and second, the models are ranked based on the consistency between the NMR data and the model assuming these optimal assignments. The low-resolution model selected using this ranking procedure had the correct overall fold and a global backbone RMSD of 6.0 angstrom, and was subsequently refined to 3.7 angstrom RMSD. With the incorporation of a small number of NOE and residual dipolar coupling constraints available very early in the traditional spectral assignment process, a model with an RMSD of 2.8 angstrom could rapidly be built. The ability to generate moderate resolution models within days of NMR data collection should facilitate large scale NMR structure determination efforts.},

abstract = {hERG1 is a member of the cyclic nucleotide binding domain family of K(+) channels. Alignment of cyclic nucleotide binding domain channels revealed an evolutionary conserved sequence HwX(A/G)C in the S5 domain. We reasoned that histidine 562 in hERG1 could play an important structure-function role. To explore this role, we created in silica models of the hERG1 pore domain based on the KvAP crystal structure with Rosetta-membrane modeling and molecular-dynamics simulations. Simulations indicate that the H562 residue in the S5 helix spans the gap between the S5 helix and the pore helix, stabilizing the pore domain, and that mutation at the H562 residue leads to a disruption of the hydrogen bonding to T618 and S621, resulting in distortion of the selectivity filter. Analysis of the simulated point mutations at positions 562/618/621 showed that the reciprocal double mutations H562W/T618I would partially restore the orientation of the 562 residue. Matching hydrophobic interactions between mutated W562 residue and I618 partially compensate for the disrupted hydrogen bonding. Complementary in vitro electrophysiological studies confirmed the results of the molecular-dynamics simulations on single mutations at positions 562, 618, and 621. Experimentally, mutations of the H562 to tryptophan produced a functional channel, but with slowed deactivation and shifted V(1/2) of activation. Furthermore, the double mutation T618I/H562W rescued the defects seen in activation, deactivation, and potassium selectivity seen with the H562W mutation. In conclusion, interactions between H562 in the S5 helix and amino acids in the pore helix are important determinants of hERG1 potassium channel function, as confirmed by theory and experiment.},

abstract = {Mutations in the human voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 are associated with predisposition to deafness and various cardiac arrhythmia syndromes including congenital long QT syndrome, familial atrial fibrillation, and sudden infant death syndrome. In this work 3-D structural models were developed for both the open and closed states of human KCNQ1 to facilitate structurally based hypotheses regarding mutation-phenotype relationships. The KCNQ1 open state was modeled using Rosetta in conjunction with Molecular Operating Environment software, and is based primarily on the recently determined open state structure of rat Kv1.2 (Long, S. B., et al. (2005) Science 309, 897-903). The closed state model for KCNQ1 was developed based on the crystal structures of bacterial potassium channels and the closed state model for Kv1.2 of Yarov-Yarovoy et al. ((2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103, 7292-7207). Using the new models for KCNQ1, we generated a database for the location and predicted residue-residue interactions for more than 85 disease-linked sites in both open and closed states. These data can be used to generate structure-based hypotheses for disease phenotypes associated with each mutation. The potential utility of these models and the database is exemplified by the surprising observation that four of the five known mutations in KCNQ1 that are associated with gain-of-function KCNQ1 defects are predicted to share a common interface in the open state structure between the S1 segment of the voltage sensor in one subunit and both the S5 segment and top of the pore helix from another subunit. This interface evidently plays an important role in channel gating.},

abstract = {We present an automatic method for docking organic ligands into protein binding sites. The method can be used in the design process of specific protein ligands. It combines an appropriate model of the physico-chemical properties of the docked molecules with efficient methods for sampling the conformational space of the ligand. If the ligand is flexible, it can adopt a large variety of different conformations. Each such minimum in conformational space presents a potential candidate for the conformation of the ligand in the complexed state. Our docking method samples the conformation space of the ligand on the basis of a discrete model and uses a tree-search technique for placing the ligand incrementally into the active site. For placing the first fragment of the ligand into the protein, we use hashing techniques adapted from computer vision. The incremental construction algorithm is based on a greedy strategy combined with efficient methods for overlap detection and for the search of new interactions. We present results on 19 complexes of which the binding geometry has been crystallographically determined. All considered ligands are docked in at most three minutes on a current workstation. The experimentally observed binding mode of the ligand is reproduced with 0.5 to 1.2 A rms deviation. It is almost always found among the highest-ranking conformations computed.},

abstract = {The Chemscore function was implemented as a scoring function for the protein-ligand docking program GOLD, and its performance compared to the original Goldscore function and two consensus docking protocols, "Goldscore-CS" and "Chemscore-GS," in terms of docking accuracy, prediction of binding affinities, and speed. In the "Goldscore-CS" protocol, dockings produced with the Goldscore function are scored and ranked with the Chemscore function; in the "Chemscore-GS" protocol, dockings produced with the Chemscore function are scored and ranked with the Goldscore function. Comparisons were made for a "clean" set of 224 protein-ligand complexes, and for two subsets of this set, one for which the ligands are "drug-like," the other for which they are "fragment-like." For "drug-like" and "fragment-like" ligands, the docking accuracies obtained with Chemscore and Goldscore functions are similar. For larger ligands, Goldscore gives superior results. Docking with the Chemscore function is up to three times faster than docking with the Goldscore function. Both combined docking protocols give significant improvements in docking accuracy over the use of the Goldscore or Chemscore function alone. "Goldscore-CS" gives success rates of up to 81% (top-ranked GOLD solution within 2.0 A of the experimental binding mode) for the "clean list," but at the cost of long search times. For most virtual screening applications, "Chemscore-GS" seems optimal; search settings that give docking speeds of around 0.25-1.3 min/compound have success rates of about 78% for "drug-like" compounds and 85% for "fragment-like" compounds. In terms of producing binding energy estimates, the Goldscore function appears to perform better than the Chemscore function and the two consensus protocols, particularly for faster search settings. Even at docking speeds of around 1-2 min/compound, the Goldscore function predicts binding energies with a standard deviation of approximately 10.5 kJ/mol.},

abstract = {Unlike other methods for docking ligands to the rigid 3D structure of a known protein receptor, Glide approximates a complete systematic search of the conformational, orientational, and positional space of the docked ligand. In this search, an initial rough positioning and scoring phase that dramatically narrows the search space is followed by torsionally flexible energy optimization on an OPLS-AA nonbonded potential grid for a few hundred surviving candidate poses. The very best candidates are further refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation; in some cases, this is crucial to obtaining an accurate docked pose. Selection of the best docked pose uses a model energy function that combines empirical and force-field-based terms. Docking accuracy is assessed by redocking ligands from 282 cocrystallized PDB complexes starting from conformationally optimized ligand geometries that bear no memory of the correctly docked pose. Errors in geometry for the top-ranked pose are less than 1 A in nearly half of the cases and are greater than 2 A in only about one-third of them. Comparisons to published data on rms deviations show that Glide is nearly twice as accurate as GOLD and more than twice as accurate as FlexX for ligands having up to 20 rotatable bonds. Glide is also found to be more accurate than the recently described Surflex method.},

abstract = {Glide's ability to identify active compounds in a database screen is characterized by applying Glide to a diverse set of nine protein receptors. In many cases, two, or even three, protein sites are employed to probe the sensitivity of the results to the site geometry. To make the database screens as realistic as possible, the screens use sets of "druglike" decoy ligands that have been selected to be representative of what we believe is likely to be found in the compound collection of a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company. Results are presented for releases 1.8, 2.0, and 2.5 of Glide. The comparisons show that average measures for both "early" and "global" enrichment for Glide 2.5 are 3 times higher than for Glide 1.8 and more than 2 times higher than for Glide 2.0 because of better results for the least well-handled screens. This improvement in enrichment stems largely from the better balance of the more widely parametrized GlideScore 2.5 function and the inclusion of terms that penalize ligand-protein interactions that violate established principles of physical chemistry, particularly as it concerns the exposure to solvent of charged protein and ligand groups. Comparisons to results for the thymidine kinase and estrogen receptors published by Rognan and co-workers (J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 4759-4767) show that Glide 2.5 performs better than GOLD 1.1, FlexX 1.8, or DOCK 4.01.},

abstract = {The development and validation of a new knowledge-based scoring function (DrugScore) to describe the binding geometry of ligands in proteins is presented. It discriminates efficiently between well-docked ligand binding modes (root-mean-square deviation <2.0 A with respect to a crystallographically determined reference complex) and those largely deviating from the native structure, e.g. generated by computer docking programs. Structural information is extracted from crystallographically determined protein-ligand complexes using ReLiBase and converted into distance-dependent pair-preferences and solvent-accessible surface (SAS) dependent singlet preferences for protein and ligand atoms. Definition of an appropriate reference state and accounting for inaccuracies inherently present in experimental data is required to achieve good predictive power. The sum of the pair preferences and the singlet preferences is calculated based on the 3D structure of protein-ligand binding modes generated by docking tools. For two test sets of 91 and 68 protein-ligand complexes, taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the calculated score recognizes poses generated by FlexX deviating <2 A from the crystal structure on rank 1 in three quarters of all possible cases. Compared to FlexX, this is a substantial improvement. For ligand geometries generated by DOCK, DrugScore is superior to the "chemical scoring" implemented into this tool, while comparable results are obtained using the "energy scoring" in DOCK. None of the presently known scoring functions achieves comparable power to extract binding modes in agreement with experiment. It is fast to compute, regards implicitly solvation and entropy contributions and produces correctly the geometry of directional interactions. Small deviations in the 3D structure are tolerated and, since only contacts to non-hydrogen atoms are regarded, it is independent from assumptions of protonation states.},

A researcher frequently wishes to evaluate the significance of a specific pattern within a protein, or to exploit knowledge of known motifs to aid the recognition of greatly diverged but homologous family members. To assist in these efforts, the pattern-hit initiated BLAST (PHI-BLAST) program described here takes as input both a protein sequence and a pattern of interest that it contains. PHI-BLAST searches a protein database for other instances of the input pattern, and uses those found as seeds for the construction of local alignments to the query sequence. The random distribution of PHI-BLAST alignment scores is studied analytically and empirically. In many instances, the program is able to detect statistically significant similarity between homologous proteins that are not recognizably related using traditional single-pass database search methods. PHI-BLAST is applied to the analysis of CED4-like cell death regulators, HS90-type ATPase domains, archaeal tRNA nucleotidyltransferases and archaeal homologs of DnaG-type DNA primases.},

abstract = {Structural and functional annotation of the large and growing database of genomic sequences is a major problem in modern biology. Protein structure prediction by detecting remote homology to known structures is a well-established and successful annotation technique. However, the broad spectrum of evolutionary change that accompanies the divergence of close homologues to become remote homologues cannot easily be captured with a single algorithm. Recent advances to tackle this problem have involved the use of multiple predictive algorithms available on the Internet. Here we demonstrate how such ensembles of predictors can be designed in-house under controlled conditions and permit significant improvements in recognition by using a concept taken from protein loop energetics and applying it to the general problem of 3D clustering. We have developed a stringent test that simulates the situation where a protein sequence of interest is submitted to multiple different algorithms and not one of these algorithms can make a confident (95%) correct assignment. A method of meta-server prediction (Phyre) that exploits the benefits of a controlled environment for the component methods was implemented. At 95% precision or higher, Phyre identified 64.0% of all correct homologous query-template relationships, and 84.0% of the individual test query proteins could be accurately annotated. In comparison to the improvement that the single best fold recognition algorithm (according to training) has over PSI-Blast, this represents a 29.6% increase in the number of correct homologous query-template relationships, and a 46.2% increase in the number of accurately annotated queries. It has been well recognised in fold prediction, other bioinformatics applications, and in many other areas, that ensemble predictions generally are superior in accuracy to any of the component individual methods. However there is a paucity of information as to why the ensemble methods are superior and indeed this has never been systematically addressed in fold recognition. Here we show that the source of ensemble power stems from noise reduction in filtering out false positive matches. The results indicate greater coverage of sequence space and improved model quality, which can consequently lead to a reduction in the experimental workload of structural genomics initiatives.},

abstract = {A central challenge in structure-based ligand design is the accurate prediction of binding free energies. Here we apply alchemical free energy calculations in explicit solvent to predict ligand binding in a model cavity in T4 lysozyme. Even in this simple site, there are challenges. We made systematic improvements, beginning with single poses from docking, then including multiple poses, additional protein conformational changes, and using an improved charge model. Computed absolute binding free energies had an RMS error of 1.9 kcal/mol relative to previously determined experimental values. In blind prospective tests, the methods correctly discriminated between several true ligands and decoys in a set of putative binders identified by docking. In these prospective tests, the RMS error in predicted binding free energies relative to those subsequently determined experimentally was only 0.6 kcal/mol. X-ray crystal structures of the new ligands bound in the cavity corresponded closely to predictions from the free energy calculations, but sometimes differed from those predicted by docking. Finally, we examined the impact of holding the protein rigid, as in docking, with a view to learning how approximations made in docking affect accuracy and how they may be improved.},

abstract = {The X-ray crystal structure of the previously unknown bacteriophage P22 lysozyme, the product of gene 19, has been determined ab initio by direct methods using the program SIR2002. The presence of several partially occupied iodine anions and samarium cations augmented the ability of direct methods to locate all 2268 non-H protein atoms in the asymmetric unit, making this one of the largest structures to date to be determined ab initio. The iodides were introduced from a quick soak, which the crystal survived sufficiently well to diffract to 1.04 angstroms resolution. The complete heavy-atom substructure contributed 6.6% of the total scattering power. The initial determination of the structure assumed that there were two iodide ions in the asymmetric unit, although it was later determined that these sites correspond to partially occupied samarium ions. Tests suggested that it is better to overestimate rather than underestimate the heavy-atom content. While experimental phases from all of the successful tests were of high quality, the best results came from a SAD experiment using the programs SHELXD and SHELXE. Nonetheless, ab initio structure determination by direct methods was found to be a viable alternative to traditional protein crystallographic methods provided that the X-ray data extend to atomic resolution and heavy atoms with sufficient scattering power are present in the crystal.},

abstract = {Protein NMR chemical shifts are highly sensitive to local structure. A robust protocol is described that exploits this relation for de novo protein structure generation, using as input experimental parameters the (13)C(alpha), (13)C(beta), (13)C', (15)N, (1)H(alpha) and (1)H(N) NMR chemical shifts. These shifts are generally available at the early stage of the traditional NMR structure determination process, before the collection and analysis of structural restraints. The chemical shift based structure determination protocol uses an empirically optimized procedure to select protein fragments from the Protein Data Bank, in conjunction with the standard ROSETTA Monte Carlo assembly and relaxation methods. Evaluation of 16 proteins, varying in size from 56 to 129 residues, yielded full-atom models that have 0.7-1.8 A root mean square deviations for the backbone atoms relative to the experimentally determined x-ray or NMR structures. The strategy also has been successfully applied in a blind manner to nine protein targets with molecular masses up to 15.4 kDa, whose conventional NMR structure determination was conducted in parallel by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium. This protocol potentially provides a new direction for high-throughput NMR structure determination.},

In particular, a 56-residue three-helical bundle protein (GA(95)) and an alpha/beta-fold protein (GB(95)), which share 95% sequence identity, were targets in the CASP-8 structure prediction contest. With only 12 out of 300 submitted server-CASP8 models for GA(95) exhibiting the correct fold, this protein proved particularly challenging despite its small size. Here, we demonstrate that the information contained in NMR chemical shifts can readily be exploited by the CS-Rosetta structure prediction program and yields adequate convergence, even when input chemical shifts are limited to just amide (1)H(N) and (15)N or (1)H(N) and (1)H(alpha) values.},

abstract = {Antibody (Ab) humanization is crucial to generate clinically relevant biologics from hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study, we integrated antibody structural information from the Protein Data Bank with known back-to-mouse mutational data to build a universal consensus of framework positions (10 heavy and 7 light) critical for the preservation of the functional conformation of the Complimentarity Determining Region of antibodies. On the basis of FR consensus, we describe here a universal combinatorial library suitable for humanizing exogenous antibodies by CDR-grafting. The six CDRs of the murine anti-human EGFR Fab M225 were grafted onto a distinct (low FR sequence similarity to M225) human FR sequence that incorporates at the 17 FR consensus positions the permutations of the naturally observed amino acid diversities. Ten clones were selected from the combinatorial library expressing phage-displayed humanized M225 Fabs. Surprisingly, 2 of the 10 clones were found to bind EGFR with stronger affinity than M225. Cell-based assays demonstrated that the 10 selected clones retained epitope specificity by blocking EGFR phosphorylation and thus hindering cellular proliferation. Our results suggest that there is a universal and structurally rigid near-CDR set of FR positions that cooperatively support the binding conformation of CDRs.

We use structure-based and sequence-based alignments for each of the test cases. All atoms, including hydrogens, are represented explicitly. The resulting models contain approximately the same number of atomic overlaps as experimentally determined crystal structures and maintain good stereochemistry. The most accurate models can be identified by their energies, and in 22 of 39 cases a model that is more accurate than the template over aligned regions is one of the 10 lowest-energy models.},

We improve computational prediction of protease/inhibitor affinity by invoking the hypothesis that the free energy of the unbound state while difficult to predict is less sensitive to mutation. Thereby the HIV-1 protease/inhibitor binding affinity can be approximated with the free energy of the bound state alone. Bound state free energy can be predicted from comparative models of HIV-1 protease mutant/inhibitor complexes. Absolute binding energies are predicted with R = 0.71 and SE = 5.91 kJ/mol. Changes in binding free energy upon mutation can be predicted with R = 0.85 and SE = 4.49 kJ/mol. Resistance mutations that lower inhibitor binding affinity can thereby be recognized early in HIV-1 protease inhibitor development.},

(Nature 2005;437:215-223), PBDID 2A65. Although the overall amino acid identity between SERTs and the LeuT(Aa) is only 17%, it increases to above 50% in the first shell of the putative 5-HT binding site, allowing de novo computational docking of tryptamine derivatives in atomic detail. Comparison of hSERT and dSERT complexed with substrates pinpoints likely structural determinants for substrate binding. Forgoing the use of experimental transport and binding data of tryptamine derivatives for construction of these models enables us to critically assess and validate their predictive power: A single 5-HT binding mode was identified that retains the amine placement observed in the LeuT(Aa) structure, matches site-directed mutagenesis and substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) data, complies with support vector machine derived relations activity relations, and predicts computational binding energies for 5-HT analogs with a significant correlation coefficient (R = 0.72). This binding mode places 5-HT deep in the binding pocket of the SERT with the 5-position near residue hSERT A169/dSERT D164 in transmembrane helix 3, the indole nitrogen next to residue Y176/Y171, and the ethylamine tail under residues F335/F327 and S336/S328 within 4 A of residue D98. Our studies identify a number of potential contacts whose contribution to substrate binding and transport was previously unsuspected.},

abstract = {As a key component in combination therapy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have been proven to be an essential way in stopping HIV-1 replication. In the present work, in silico studies were conducted on a series of 119 NNRTIs, including 1-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)-6-(phenylthio)thymine (HEPT) and dihydroalkoxybenzyloxopyrimidine (DABO) derivatives by using the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA), comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA), docking simulations and molecular dynamics (MD). The statistical results of the optimal model, the ligand-based CoMSIA one (Q(2) = 0.48, R (ncv) (2) =0.847, R (pre) (2)  = 0.745) validates its satisfactory predictive capacity both internally and externally. The contour maps, docking and MD results correlate well with each other, drawing conclusions as follows: 1) Compounds with bulky substituents in position-6 of ring A, hydrophobic groups around position- 1, 2, 6 are preferable to the biological activities; 2) Two hydrogen bonds between RT inhibitor and the Tyr 318, Lys 101 residues, respectively, and a $\pi$-$\pi$ bond between the inhibitor and Trp 188 are formed and crucial to the orientation of the active conformation of the molecules; 3) The binding pocket is essentially hydrophobic, which are determined by residues such as Trp 229, Tyr 318, Val 179, Tyr 188 and Val 108, and hydrophobic substituents may bring an improvement to the biological activity; 4) DABO and HEPT derivatives have different structures but take a similar mechanism to inhibit RT. The potency difference between two isomers in HEPTs can be explained by the distinct locations of the 6-naphthylmethyl substituent and the reasons are explained in details. All these results could be employed to alter the structural scaffold in order to develop new HIV-1 RT inhibitors that have an improved biological property. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on 3D-QSAR modeling of this series of HEPT and DABO NNRTs. The QSAR model and the information derived, we hope, will be of great help in presenting clear guidelines and accurate activity predictions for newly designed HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor.},

So far three distinct alpha(1)-AR subtypes, alpha(1A), alpha(1B) and alpha(1D), have been characterized by functional analysis, radio-ligand binding and molecular biology studies. The alpha(1)-ARs are of therapeutic interest because of their distinct and critical roles in many physiological processes, containing hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, smooth muscle contraction, myocardial inotropy and chronotropy, and hepatic glucose metabolism. Accordingly, designing subtype-selective antagonists for each of the three alpha(1)-AR subtypes has been an enthusiastic region of medicinal research. Even though a large number of studies on GPCRs have been conducted, understanding of how known antagonists bind to alpha(1)-ARs still remains sketchy and has been a serious impediment to search for potent and subtype-selective alpha(1)-AR antagonists because of the lack of detailed experimental structural knowledge. This review deliberates the simulation of alpha(1)-ARs and their interactions with antagonists by using ligand-based (pharmacophore identification and QSAR modeling) and structure-based (comparative modeling and molecular docking) approaches. Combined with experimental data, these computational attempts could improve our understanding of the structural basis of antagonist binding and the molecular basis of receptor activation, thus offering a more reasonable approach in the design of drugs targeting alpha(1)-ARs.},

The incremental construction strategy is tested with a panel of 15 crystallographic testcases, created from 12 unique complexes whose ligands vary in size and flexibility. For all testcases, at least one docked position is generated within 2 A of the crystallographic position. For 7 of 15 testcases, the top scoring position is also within 2 A of the crystallographic position. The algorithm is fast enough to successfully dock a few testcases within seconds and most within 100 s. The incremental construction and the random search strategy are evaluated as database docking techniques with a database of 51 molecules docked to two of the crystallographic testcases. Incremental construction outperforms random search and is fast enough to reliably rank the database of compounds within 15 s per molecule on an SGI R10000 cpu.},

abstract = {Protein-small molecule docking algorithms provide a means to model the structure of protein-small molecule complexes in structural detail and play an important role in drug development. In recent years the necessity of simulating protein side-chain flexibility for an accurate prediction of the protein-small molecule interfaces has become apparent, and an increasing number of docking algorithms probe different approaches to include protein flexibility. Here we describe a new method for docking small molecules into protein binding sites employing a Monte Carlo minimization procedure in which the rigid body position and orientation of the small molecule and the protein side-chain conformations are optimized simultaneously. The energy function comprises van der Waals (VDW) interactions, an implicit solvation model, an explicit orientation hydrogen bonding potential, and an electrostatics model. In an evaluation of the scoring function the computed energy correlated with experimental small molecule binding energy with a correlation coefficient of 0.63 across a diverse set of 229 protein- small molecule complexes. The docking method produced lowest energy models with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) smaller than 2 A in 71 out of 100 protein-small molecule crystal structure complexes (self-docking). In cross-docking calculations in which both protein side-chain and small molecule internal degrees of freedom were varied the lowest energy predictions had RMSDs less than 2 A in 14 of 20 test cases.},

abstract = {Although antibodies can be elicited by HIV-1 infection or immunization, those that are broadly neutralizing (bnAbs) are undetectable in most individuals, and when they do arise in HIV-1 infection, only do so years after transmission. Until recently, the reasons for difficulty in inducing such bnAbs have been obscure. Recent technological advances in isolating bnAbs from rare patients have increased our knowledge of their specificities and features, and along with gene-targeting studies, have also begun uncovering evidence of immunoregulatory roadblocks preventing their induction. One crucial avenue towards developing an effective HIV-1 vaccine is to harness this emerging information into the rational design of immunogens and formulation of adjuvants, such that structural and immunological hurdles to routinely eliciting bnAbs can be overcome.},

HIV-1 was isolated during symptomatic primary HIV-1 infection and repeatedly thereafter, and tested against autologous sera collected in parallel. Our patients developed isolate-specific low-titer neutralizing antibodies within 2-4 weeks, and the titers to the first isolates increased with time. We documented the emergence of virus variants with reduced sensitivity to neutralization by autologous, but not heterologous, sera in three patients. These virus variants were not, however, resistant to neutralization per se, since they were readily neutralized by the positive control serum. Our patients did not develop antibodies capable of neutralizing the new virus variants during the observation period. This suggests either a failure of the immune system to respond to the new virus variants or a mechanism by which the virus evades detection by the immune system. The emergence of neutralization-resistant virus variants was not directly correlated with disease progression since two patients have remained asymptomatic after the emergence of such virus variants. It is, however, likely that the emergence of virus variants which the patient fails to neutralize in the long run contributes to disease progression.},

In this study, we assessed the autologous and heterologous neutralization responses of 14 HIV-1 subtype C-infected individuals, using envelope clones obtained within the first 2 months postinfection. Our data show that potent but relatively strain-specific neutralizing antibodies develop within 3 to 12 months of HIV-1 infection. The magnitude of this response was associated with shorter V1-to-V5 envelope lengths and fewer glycosylation sites, particularly in the V1-V2 region. Anti-MPER antibodies were detected in 4 of 14 individuals within a year of infection, while antibodies to CD4-induced (CD4i) epitopes developed to high titers in 12 participants, in most cases before the development of autologous neutralizing antibodies. However, neither anti-MPER nor anti-CD4i antibody specificity conferred neutralization breadth. These data provide insights into the kinetics, potency, breadth, and epitope specificity of neutralizing antibody responses in acute HIV-1 subtype C infection.},

Undiluted sera from long-term nonprogressors (LTNP) had broad neutralizing antibodies against heterologous primary isolates and were more likely to neutralize the contemporaneous autologous isolate than were sera from short-term nonprogressors and progressors. In primary infection, envelope-specific IgG was detected before the initial decline in plasma viremia, but neutralizing antibodies developed more slowly. Here, neutralizing antibodies against strains SF-2 and MN were sometimes the first to be detected, but titers were low for at least 17 weeks from onset of symptoms. Neutralizing antibodies against the early autologous isolate were detected for 4 patients by 5-40 weeks but were undetectable in 2 additional patients for 27-45 weeks. The results indicate that neutralizing antibody responses are slow to develop during primary infection and are uniquely broad in LTNP.},

abstract = {A recombinant virus assay was used to characterize in detail neutralizing antibody responses directed at circulating autologous HIV in plasma. Examining serial plasma specimens in a matrix format, most patients with primary HIV infection rapidly generated significant neutralizing antibody responses to early (0-39 months) autologous viruses, whereas responses to laboratory and heterologous primary strains were often lower and delayed. Plasma virus continually and rapidly evolved to escape neutralization, indicating that neutralizing antibody exerts a level of selective pressure that has been underappreciated based on earlier, less comprehensive characterizations. These data argue that neutralizing antibody responses account for the extensive variation in the envelope gene that is observed in the early months after primary HIV infection.},

abstract = {One aim for an HIV vaccine is to elicit neutralizing antibodies (Nab) that can limit replication of genetically diverse viruses and prevent establishment of a new infection. Thus, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of Nab during the early stages of natural infection could prove useful in achieving this goal. Here we demonstrate that viral escape readily occurred despite the development of high titer autologous Nab in two subjects with acute/early subtype C infection. To provide a detailed portrayal of the escape pathways, Nab resistant variants identified at multiple time points were used to create a series of envelope (Env) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants within the background of a corresponding newly transmitted Env. In one subject, Nab escape was driven predominantly by changes in the region of gp120 that extends from the beginning of the V3 domain to the end of the V5 domain (V3V5). However, Nab escape pathways in this subject oscillated and at times required cooperation between V1V2 and the gp41 ectodomain. In the second subject, escape was driven by changes in V1V2. This V1V2-dependent escape pathway was retained over time, and its utility was reflected in the virus's ability to escape from two distinct monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) derived from this same patient via introduction of a single potential N-linked glycosylation site in V2. Spatial representation of the sequence changes in gp120 suggested that selective pressure acted upon the same regions of Env in these two subjects, even though the Env domains that drove escape were different. Together the findings argue that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in early subtype C HIV-1 infection, and support a model in which multiple strategies, including potential glycan shifts, direct alteration of an epitope sequence, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.},

abstract = {Over the course of infection, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) continuously adapts to evade the evolving host neutralizing antibody responses. Changes in the envelope variable loop sequences, particularly the extent of glycosylation, have been implicated in antibody escape. To document modifications that potentially influence antibody susceptibility, we compared envelope variable loops 1 and 2 (V1-V2) from multiple sequences isolated at the primary phase of infection to those isolated around 2 to 3 years into the chronic phase of infection in nine women with HIV-1 subtype A. HIV-1 sequences isolated during chronic infection had significantly longer V1-V2 loops, with a significantly higher number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites, than the sequences isolated early in infection. To assess the effects of these V1-V2 changes on antibody neutralization and infectivity, we created chimeric envelope sequences, which incorporated a subject's V1-V2 sequences into a common subtype A envelope backbone and then used them to generate pseudotyped viruses. Compared to the parent virus, the introduction of a subject's early-infection V1-V2 envelope variable loops rendered the chimeric envelope more sensitive to that subject's plasma samples but only to plasma samples collected >6 months after the sequences were isolated. Neutralization was not detected with the same plasma when the early-infection V1-V2 sequences were replaced with chronic-infection V1-V2 sequences, suggesting that changes in V1-V2 contribute to antibody escape. Pseudotyped viruses with V1-V2 segments from different times in infection, however, showed no significant difference in neutralization sensitivity to heterologous pooled plasma, suggesting that viruses with V1-V2 loops from early in infection were not inherently more neutralization sensitive. Pseudotyped viruses bearing chimeric envelopes with early-infection V1-V2 sequences showed a trend in infecting cells with low CD4 concentrations more efficiently, while engineered viruses with V1-V2 sequences isolated during chronic infection were moderately better at infecting cells with low CCR5 concentrations. These studies suggest that changes within the V1-V2 envelope domains over the course of an infection influence sensitivity to autologous neutralizing antibodies and may also impact host receptor/coreceptor interactions.},

The antibodies 2F5 and 2G12 have been identified to be two of the most potently in vitro neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1. Here we report on a further antibody, 4E10, of similar in vitro neutralizing potency. 4E10 binds to a novel epitope C terminal of the ELDKWA sequence recognized by 2F5, which has been so far the only described broadly neutralizing anti-gp41 antibody. Both 4E10 and 2F5 bind only weakly to infected cells compared with gp120-specific 2G12 and polyclonal anti-HIV-1 immunoglobulin (HIVIG), but show potent in vitro neutralizing properties. 4E10 neutralizes potently not only tissue culture-adapted strains but also primary isolates of different clades, including A, B, C, D, and E. Viruses that were found to be resistant to 2F5 were neutralized by 4E10 and vice versa; none of the tested isolates was resistant to both anti-gp41 antibodies. This confirms that the region recognized by 2F5 and 4E10 is essential for viral infectivity and may be important for vaccine design. Moreover, our results suggest that 4E10 should be further investigated for passive anti-HIV immunotherapy.},

abstract = {At least five distinct genetic subtypes (genotypes) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been identified by DNA sequencing. Current vaccine candidates are based on virus strains from North America and Europe that represent only one subtype. The extent to which distinct genotypes of HIV-1 correspond to antigenically distinguishable serotypes is largely unknown and may be critically important to vaccine design. Cross-neuralization studies were done with viruses and plasma from two different genotypes. Based on neutralization susceptibility, 10 primary HIV-1 isolates from Thailand and the United States were classified into one of two antigenic subtypes that correlated with viral genotype. The existence of serotypes of HIV-1 suggests that a broadly effective vaccine may have to include strains from multiple subtypes. Neutralization of these primary HIV-1 isolates differed substantially from results with laboratory strains. Future neutralization studies using primary isolates and multiple genotypes may be important for assessment of HIV-1 antigenic diversity.},

abstract = {A blinded study to assess the state of the art in three-dimensional structure modeling of the variable region (Fv) of antibodies was conducted. Nine unpublished high-resolution x-ray Fab crystal structures covering a wide range of antigen-binding site conformations were used as benchmark to compare Fv models generated by four structure prediction methodologies. The methodologies included two homology modeling strategies independently developed by CCG (Chemical Computer Group) and Accerlys Inc, and two fully automated antibody modeling servers: PIGS (Prediction of ImmunoGlobulin Structure), based on the canonical structure model, and Rosetta Antibody Modeling, based on homology modeling and Rosetta structure prediction methodology. The benchmark structure sequences were submitted to Accelrys and CCG and a set of models for each of the nine antibody structures were generated. PIGS and Rosetta models were obtained using the default parameters of the servers. In most cases, we found good agreement between the models and x-ray structures. The average rmsd (root mean square deviation) values calculated over the backbone atoms between the models and structures were fairly consistent, around 1.2 {\AA}. Average rmsd values of the framework and hypervariable loops with canonical structures (L1, L2, L3, H1, and H2) were close to 1.0 {\AA}. H3 prediction yielded rmsd values around 3.0 {\AA} for most of the models. Quality assessment of the models and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the methods are discussed. We hope this initiative will serve as a model of scientific partnership and look forward to future antibody modeling assessments. Proteins 2011; {\copyright} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Probable germline gene sequences from thousands of aligned mature Ab sequences are inferred using simple computational matching to known V(D)J genes. Comparison of the germline to mature sequences in a structural region-dependent fashion allows insights into the methods that nature uses to mature Abs during the somatic hypermutation process. Four factors determine the residue type mutation patterns: biases in the germline, accessibility from single base permutations, location of mutation hotspots, and functional pressures during selection. Germline repertoires at positions that commonly contact the Ag are biased with tyrosine, serine, and tryptophan. These residue types have a high tendency to be present in mutation hotspot motifs, and their abundance is decreased during maturation by a net conversion to other types. The heavy use of tyrosines on mature Ab interfaces is thus a reflection of the germline composition rather than being due to selection during maturation. Potentially stabilizing changes such as increased proline usage and a small number of double cysteine mutations capable of forming disulfide bonds are ascribed to somatic hypermutation. Histidine is the only residue type for which usage increases in each of the interface, core, and surface regions. The net overall effect is a conversion from residue types that could provide nonspecific initial binding into a diversity of types that improve affinity and stability. Average mutation probabilities are approximately 4% for core residues, approximately 5% for surface residues, and approximately 12% for residues in common Ag-contacting positions, excepting the those coded by the D gene.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:An effective HIV-1 vaccine or microbicide must block the transmitted virus variants that initially establish a new infection; consequently, it is critical that such viruses be isolated and characterized.

OBJECTIVE:To evaluate HIV-1 envelope variants from early in infection from individuals infected heterosexually with subtype A HIV-1 for their sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization and to inhibitors of viral entry.

METHODS:Full-length subtype A HIV-1 envelope clones from 28-75 days postinfection were used to generate pseudoviruses for infection studies. The susceptibility of these pseudoviruses to neutralization by autologous and heterologous plasma and by monoclonal antibodies was examined. The sensitivity of these pseudoviruses to PSC-RANTES and TAK-779, inhibitors of CCR5, and to soluble CD4 (sCD4) was also evaluated.

RESULTS:Pseudoviruses with subtype A HIV-1 envelopes from early in infection demonstrated a broad range of neutralization sensitivities to both autologous and heterologous plasma. However, neutralization by the monoclonal antibodies b12, 2G12, 4E10 and 2F5 was generally poor; notably, none of the 14 early virus variants were neutralized by 2G12 and only one was neutralized by b12. Viruses bearing these early CCR5-using envelopes were generally sensitive to the CCR5 inhibitors PSC-RANTES and TAK-779, but they demonstrated more variable sensitivity to sCD4.

CONCLUSIONS:These subtype A HIV-1 variants, representing the viruses that must be blocked by antibody-based prevention strategies, vary in their susceptibility to neutralization. A subset of these HIV-1 variants from early in infection will be useful for screening candidate vaccines and microbicides.},

We examined correlates of NAb response breadth among 70 HIV-infected, antiretroviral-na{\"\i}ve Kenyan women from a longitudinal seroincident cohort. NAb response breadth was measured 5 years after infection against five subtype A viruses and one subtype B virus. Greater NAb response breadth was associated with a higher viral load set point and greater HIV-1 env diversity early in infection. However, greater NAb response breadth was not associated with a delayed time to a CD4(+) T-cell count of <200, antiretroviral therapy, or death. Thus, a broad NAb response results from a high level of antigenic stimulation early in infection, which likely accounts for prior observations that greater NAb response breadth is associated with a higher viral load later in infection.},

abstract = {Maternal passive immunity typically plays a critical role in protecting infants from new infections; however, the specific contribution of neutralizing antibodies in limiting mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is unclear. By examining cloned envelope variants from 12 transmission pairs, we found that vertically transmitted variants were more resistant to neutralization by maternal plasma than were maternal viral variants near the time of transmission. The vertically transmitted envelope variants were poorly neutralized by monoclonal antibodies b12 [corrected] 2G12, 2F5, and 4E10 individually or in combination. Despite the fact that the infant viruses were among the most neutralization resistant in the mother, they had relatively few glycosylation sites. Moreover, the transmitted variants elicited de novo neutralizing antibodies in the infants, indicating that they were not inherently difficult to neutralize. The neutralization resistance of vertically transmitted viruses is in contrast to the relative neutralization sensitivity of viruses sexually transmitted within discordant couples, suggesting that the antigenic properties of viruses that are favored for transmission may differ depending upon mode of transmission.},

abstract = {The prolactin-releasing peptide receptor and its bioactive RF-amide peptide (PrRP20) have been investigated to explore the ligand binding mode of peptide G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). By receptor mutagenesis, we identified the conserved aspartate in the upper transmembrane helix 6 (Asp(6.59)) of the receptor as the first position that directly interacts with arginine 19 of the ligand (Arg(19)). Replacement of Asp(6.59) with Arg(19) of PrRP20 led to D6.59R, which turned out to be a constitutively active receptor mutant (CAM). This suggests that the mutated residue at the top of transmembrane helix 6 mimics Arg(19) by interacting with additional binding partners in the receptor. Next, we generated an initial comparative model of this CAM because no ligand docking was required, and we selected the next set of receptor mutants to find the engaged partners of the binding pocket. In an iterative process, we identified two acidic residues and two hydrophobic residues that form the peptide ligand binding pocket. As all residues are localized on top or in the upper part of the transmembrane domains, we clearly can show that the extracellular surface of the receptor is sufficient for full signal transduction for prolactin-releasing peptide, rather than a deep, membrane-embedded binding pocket. This contributes to the knowledge of the binding of peptide ligands to GPCRs and might facilitate the development of GPCR ligands, but it also provides new targeting of CAMs involved in hereditary diseases.},

RESULTS:We present LIGSITEcsc, an extension and implementation of the LIGSITE algorithm. LIGSITEcsc is based on the notion of surface-solvent-surface events and the degree of conservation of the involved surface residues. We compare our algorithm to four other approaches, LIGSITE, CAST, PASS, and SURFNET, and evaluate all on a dataset of 48 unbound/bound structures and 210 bound-structures. LIGSITEcsc performs slightly better than the other tools and achieves a success rate of 71% and 75%, respectively.

CONCLUSION:The use of the Connolly surface leads to slight improvements, the prediction re-ranking by conservation to significant improvements of the binding site predictions. A web server for LIGSITEcsc and its source code is available at scoppi.biotec.tu-dresden.de/pocket},

Various neutralizing epitope specificities were determined for the top 9 neutralizers, including clade A-, clade B-, clade C-, and clade A/C-infected donors, by using a comprehensive set of assays. In some subjects, neutralization breadth was mediated by two or more antibody specificities. Although antibodies to the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER) were identified in some subjects, the subjects with the greatest neutralization breadth targeted gp120 epitopes, including the CD4 binding site, a glycan-containing quaternary epitope formed by the V2 and V3 loops, or an outer domain epitope containing a glycan at residue N332. The broadly reactive HIV-1 neutralization observed in some subjects is mediated by antibodies targeting several conserved regions on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.},

abstract = {Predicting functional sites in proteins is important in structural biology for understanding the function and also for structure-based drug design. Here we report a new binding site prediction method PocketDepth, which is geometry based and uses a depth based clustering. Depth is an important parameter considered during protein structure visualisation and analysis but has been used more often intuitively than systematically. Our current implementation of depth reflects how central a given subspace is to a putative pocket. We have tested the algorithm against PDBbind, a large curated set of 1091 proteins. A prediction was considered a true-positive if the predicted pocket had at least 10% overlap with the actual ligand. Two different parameter sets, 'deeper' and 'surface' were used, for wider coverage of different types of binding sites in proteins. With deeper parameters, true-positives were observed for 841 proteins, resulting in a prediction accuracy of 77%, for any ranked prediction. Of these, 55.2% were first ranked predictions, whereas 91.2% and 97.4% were covered in the first 5 and 10 ranks, respectively. With the 'surface' parameters, a prediction rate of 95.8% was observed, albeit with much poorer ranks. The deeper set identified pocket boundaries more precisely and yielded better ranks, while the latter missed fewer predictions and hence had better coverage. The two parameter sets were therefore algorithmically combined, resulting in prediction accuracies of 96.5% for any ranked prediction. About 41.8% of these were in the first rank, 82% and 94% were in top 5 and 10 ranks, respectively. The algorithm is available at http://proline.physics.iisc.ernet.in/pocketdepth.},

Within only a few minutes it returns the search results in a user-friendly format similar to that of PSI-BLAST. Search options include local or global alignment and scoring secondary structure similarity. HHpred can produce pairwise query-template alignments, multiple alignments of the query with a set of templates selected from the search results, as well as 3D structural models that are calculated by the MODELLER software from these alignments. A detailed help facility is available. As a demonstration, we analyze the sequence of SpoVT, a transcriptional regulator from Bacillus subtilis.

The study is designed to develop a reliable prediction method using an alternative technique and to investigate the applicability of SVMs to this type of bioinformatics problem.

METHODS:Binary SVMs are trained to discriminate between two structural classes. The binary classifiers are combined in several ways to predict multi-class secondary structure.

RESULTS:The average three-state prediction accuracy per protein (Q(3)) is estimated by cross-validation to be 77.07 +/- 0.26% with a segment overlap (Sov) score of 73.32 +/- 0.39%. The SVM performs similarly to the 'state-of-the-art' PSIPRED prediction method on a non-homologous test set of 121 proteins despite being trained on substantially fewer examples. A simple consensus of the SVM, PSIPRED and PROFsec achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy than the individual methods.},

The lineage comprises three mature antibodies, the unmutated common ancestor, and a common intermediate. Their heavy-chain complementarity determining region inserts into the conserved receptor-binding pocket of influenza HA. We show by analysis of structures, binding kinetics and long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations that antibody evolution in this lineage has rigidified the initially flexible heavy-chain complementarity determining region by two nearly independent pathways and that this preconfiguration accounts for most of the affinity gain. The results advance our understanding of strategies for developing more broadly effective influenza vaccines.},

These glycoproteins exhibit a high degree of sequence variability and glycosylation, which are used as strategies to escape host immune responses. Nonetheless, antibodies with broadly neutralizing activity against these viruses have been isolated that have managed to overcome these barriers. Here, we review recent advances in the structural characterization of these antibodies with their viral antigens that defines a few sites of vulnerability on these viral spikes. These broadly neutralizing antibodies tend to focus their recognition on the sites of similar function between the two viruses: the receptor-binding site and membrane fusion machinery. However, some sites of recognition are unique to the virus neutralized, such as the dense shield of oligomannose carbohydrates on HIV-1 Env. These observations are discussed in the context of structure-based design strategies to aid in vaccine design or development of antivirals.},

HIV-1 vaccine research has encountered several false starts and a few causes for hope over the last 28 years, but no real success stories. Thus, it is time to think out of the box and design and test unorthodox vaccination strategies.

AREAS COVERED:Recent studies in mice and monkeys have revealed the potential of a gene therapy that provides vaccine-like protection against HIV-1 infection by producing a potent vector-encoded antibody that neutralizes the invading viruses. This novel strategy is called Vectored Immuno Prophylaxis or VIP, and it circumvents the sometimes difficult phases of regular vaccination protocols, that is, antigen design and induction of protective immune responses.

EXPERT OPINION:VIP is a prolonged form of passive immunization by means of a gene therapy. We will discuss the ins and outs of VIP and the therapeutic possibilities and challenges.},

Not only do they act as connectors between two regular secondary structural elements of proteins but they also provide the necessary turn or reversal in the polypeptide chain. This incorporates flexibility in the structure. Thus an understanding of the structural aspects of the nonregular regions is necessary to have a better insight into these features. We can assume the nonregular region to be a contorted polypeptide segment tethered by regular secondary structured regions at both ends. To describe the undulating nature of the nonregular regions, we introduce a parameter called the "contortion index." This index describes how tortuously the region is organized. Our analysis shows that the contortion index is related to other physicochemical parameters and can be used to characterize the nonregular regions of proteins.},

Here we define the developmental pathway by which such antibodies are generated and acquire the requisite molecular characteristics for neutralization. Twelve somatically related neutralizing antibodies (CAP256-VRC26.01-12) were isolated from donor CAP256 (from the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA)); each antibody contained the protruding tyrosine-sulphated, anionic antigen-binding loop (complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3) characteristic of this category of antibodies. Their unmutated ancestor emerged between weeks 30-38 post-infection with a 35-residue CDR H3, and neutralized the virus that superinfected this individual 15 weeks after initial infection. Improved neutralization breadth and potency occurred by week 59 with modest affinity maturation, and was preceded by extensive diversification of the virus population. HIV-1 V1V2-directed neutralizing antibodies can thus develop relatively rapidly through initial selection of B cells with a long CDR H3, and limited subsequent somatic hypermutation. These data provide important insights relevant to HIV-1 vaccine development.},

A great deal of effort is directed internationally at understanding the ontogeny of NAbs during infection as well as in designing and testing immunogens that can elicit bNAbs in animal models and in humans. Given the parrying tactics of Env, multiple approaches, along with high-resolution structural studies, will be needed to reach a degree of understanding sufficient to design an effective vaccine. We discuss and note here some of the most important recent advances in our knowledge of how neutralizing antibodies develop in vivo, the recent discovery of extremely powerful neutralizing monoclonal antibodies isolated from natural infection, enhanced methodologies that have accelerated discoveries on both fronts, and the progress made in eliciting potent NAbs with limited breadth by vaccination.},

abstract = {Abstract   No vaccine candidate has induced antibodies (Abs) that efficiently neutralize multiple primary isolates of HIV-1. Preexisting high titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are essential, because the virus establishes infection before anamnestic responses could take effect. HIV-1 infection elicits Abs against Env, Gag, and other viral proteins, but of these only a subset of the anti-Env Abs can neutralize the virus. Whereas the corresponding proteins from other viruses form the basis of successful vaccines, multiple large doses of HIV-1 Env elicit low, transient titers of Abs that are not protective in humans. The inaccessibility of neutralization epitopes hinders NAb induction, but Env may also subvert the immune response by interacting with receptors on T cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Here, we discuss evidence from immunizations of different species with various modified Env constructs. We also suggest how the divergent Ab responses to Gag and Env during infection may reflect differences in B cell regulation. Drawing on these analyses, we outline strategies for improving Env as a component of a vaccine aimed at inducing strong and sustained NAb responses.},

abstract = {The membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1, located at the C terminus of the gp41 ectodomain, is conserved and crucial for viral fusion. Three broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs), 2F5, 4E10, and Z13e1, are directed against linear epitopes mapped to the MPER, making this conserved region an important potential vaccine target. However, no MPER antibodies have been definitively shown to provide protection against HIV challenge. Here, we show that both MAbs 2F5 and 4E10 can provide complete protection against mucosal simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge in macaques. MAb 2F5 or 4E10 was administered intravenously at 50 mg/kg to groups of six male Indian rhesus macaques 1 day prior to and again 1 day following intrarectal challenge with SHIV(Ba-L). In both groups, five out of six animals showed complete protection and sterilizing immunity, while for one animal in each group a low level of viral replication following challenge could not be ruled out. The study confirms the protective potential of 2F5 and 4E10 and supports emphasis on HIV immunogen design based on the MPER region of gp41.},

Intriguingly, the IGVK3-11 and IGVH3-30 V-genes are repeatedly paired in protective Abs against the 23F polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as against the gB envelope protein of human CMV, where germline-encoded amino acids make key contacts with the gB protein. We constructed IgGs encoded by the germline IGVK3-11 and IGVH3-30 V-genes together with DNA encoding the respective CDR3 regions of the L chain and H chain found in a hypermutated anti-23F Ab. These IgGs encoded by germline V-genes bound specifically to 23F pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides with no reactivity to other serotypes of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides or arrayed glycans and recognized L-rhamnose, a component of the 23F repeating subunit. IgGs encoded by this pair of germline V-genes mediated complement-dependent phagocytosis of encapsulated 23F S. pneumoniae by human neutrophils. Mutations in CDRL3 and CDRH3 had significant effects on binding. Thus, IGKV3-11 and IGHV3-30, depending on with which distinct DNA sequences encoding CDR3 they are recombined, can encode binding sites for protective Abs against chemically distinct Ags and thus, may encode innate immunological memory against human CMV and S. pneumoniae.},

abstract = {Neutralizing antibodies are thought to be crucial for HIV vaccine protection, but studies in animal models suggest that high antibody concentrations are required. This is a major potential hurdle for vaccine design. However, these studies typically apply a large virus inoculum to ensure infection in control animals in single-challenge experiments. In contrast, most human infection via sexual encounter probably involves repeated exposures to much lower doses of virus. Therefore, animal studies may have provided an overestimate of the levels of antibodies required for protection in humans. We investigated whether plasma concentrations of antibody corresponding to relatively modest neutralization titers in vitro could protect macaques from repeated intravaginal exposure to low doses of a simian immunodeficiency virus-HIV chimera (SHIV) that uses the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) co-receptor. An effector function-deficient variant of the neutralizing antibody was also included. The results show that a substantially larger number of challenges is required to infect macaques treated with neutralizing antibody than control antibody-treated macaques, and support the notion that effector function may contribute to antibody protection. Overall, the results imply that lower amounts of antibody than previously considered protective may provide benefit in the context of typical human exposure to HIV-1.},

abstract = {Developing an immunogen that elicits broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) is an elusive but important goal of HIV vaccine research, especially after the recent failure of the leading T cell based HIV vaccine in human efficacy trials. Even if such an immunogen can be developed, most animal model studies indicate that high serum neutralizing concentrations of bNAbs are required to provide significant benefit in typical protection experiments. One possible exception is provided by the anti-glycan bNAb 2G12, which has been reported to protect macaques against CXCR4-using SHIV challenge at relatively low serum neutralizing titers. Here, we investigated the ability of 2G12 administered intravenously (i.v.) to protect against vaginal challenge of rhesus macaques with the CCR5-using SHIV(SF162P3). The results show that, at 2G12 serum neutralizing titers of the order of 1:1 (IC(90)), 3/5 antibody-treated animals were protected with sterilizing immunity, i.e. no detectable virus replication following challenge; one animal showed a delayed and lowered primary viremia and the other animal showed a course of infection similar to 4 control animals. This result contrasts strongly with the typically high titers observed for protection by other neutralizing antibodies, including the bNAb b12. We compared b12 and 2G12 for characteristics that might explain the differences in protective ability relative to neutralizing activity. We found no evidence to suggest that 2G12 transudation to the vaginal surface was significantly superior to b12. We also observed that the ability of 2G12 to inhibit virus replication in target cells through antibody-mediated effector cell activity in vitro was equivalent or inferior to b12. The results raise the possibility that some epitopes on HIV may be better vaccine targets than others and support targeting the glycan shield of the envelope.},

However, characterization of this response against autologous virus at the monoclonal antibody (MAb) level has only recently begun to be elucidated. Here we describe five monoclonal antibodies derived from a subtype C-infected seroconverter and their neutralizing activities against pseudoviruses that carry envelope glycoproteins from 48 days (0 month), 2 months, and 8 months after the estimated time of infection. Sequence analysis indicated that the MAbs arose from three distinct B cell clones, and their pattern of neutralization compared to that in patient plasma suggested that they circulated between 2 and 8 months after infection. Neutralization by MAbs representative of each B cell clone was mapped to two residues: position 134 in V1 and position 189 in V2. Mutational analysis revealed cooperative effects between glycans and residues at these two positions, arguing that they contribute to a single epitope. Analysis of the cognate gp120 sequence through homology modeling places this potential epitope near the interface between the V1 and V2 loops. Additionally, the escape mutation R189S in V2, which conferred resistance against all three MAbs, had no detrimental effect on virus replication in vitro. Taken together, our data demonstrate that independent B cells repeatedly targeted a single structure in V1V2 during early infection. Despite this assault, a single amino acid change was sufficient to confer complete escape with minimal impact on replication fitness.},

We used these fingerprints to delineate specificities of polyclonal sera from 24 HIV-1-infected donors and a chimeric siman-human immunodeficiency virus-infected macaque. Delineated specificities matched published specificities and were further confirmed by antibody isolation for two sera. Patterns of virus-isolate neutralization can thus afford a detailed epitope-specific understanding of neutralizing-antibody responses to viral infection.},

Genetic analysis of trial viruses revealed increased vaccine efficacy against viruses matching the vaccine strain at V2 residue 169. Here, we isolated four V2 monoclonal antibodies from RV144 vaccinees that recognize residue 169, neutralize laboratory-adapted HIV-1, and mediate killing of field-isolate HIV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells. Crystal structures of two of the V2 antibodies demonstrated that residue 169 can exist within divergent helical and loop conformations, which contrasted dramatically with the $\beta$ strand conformation previously observed with a broadly neutralizing antibody PG9. Thus, RV144 vaccine-induced immune pressure appears to target a region that may be both sequence variable and structurally polymorphic. Variation may signal sites of HIV-1 envelope vulnerability, providing vaccine designers with new options.},

Here we review the interaction of the RAG proteins with DNA, the chemistry of the cleavage reaction, and the higher order complexes in which these events take place. We also discuss postcleavage functions of the RAG proteins, including recent evidence indicating that they initiate the process of coding end processing by nicking hairpin DNA termini. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary and functional implications of the finding that RAG1 and RAG2 constitute a transposase, and we consider RAG protein biochemistry in the context of several bacterial transposition systems. This suggests a model of the RAG protein active site in which two divalent metal ions serve alternating and opposite roles as activators of attacking hydroxyl groups and stabilizers of oxyanion leaving groups.},

abstract = {IMGT/V-QUEST is the highly customized and integrated system for the standardized analysis of the immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) rearranged nucleotide sequences. IMGT/V-QUEST identifies the variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes and alleles by alignment with the germline IG and TR gene and allele sequences of the IMGT reference directory. New functionalities were added through a complete rewrite in Java. IMGT/V-QUEST analyses batches of sequences (up to 50) in a single run. IMGT/V-QUEST describes the V-REGION mutations and identifies the hot spot positions in the closest germline V gene. IMGT/V-QUEST can detect insertions and deletions in the submitted sequences by reference to the IMGT unique numbering. IMGT/V-QUEST integrates IMGT/JunctionAnalysis for a detailed analysis of the V-J and V-D-J junctions, and IMGT/Automat for a full V-J- and V-D-J-REGION annotation. IMGT/V-QUEST displays, in 'Detailed view', the results and alignments for each submitted sequence individually and, in 'Synthesis view', the alignments of the sequences that, in a given run, express the same V gene and allele. The 'Advanced parameters' allow to modify default parameters used by IMGT/V-QUEST and IMGT/JunctionAnalysis according to the users' interest. IMGT/V-QUEST is freely available for academic research at http://imgt.cines.fr.},

abstract = {Receptor-binding specificity of HA, the major surface glycoprotein of influenza virus, primarily determines the host ranges that the virus can infect. Influenza type B virus almost exclusively infects humans and contributes to the annual "flu" sickness. Here we report the structures of influenza B virus HA in complex with human and avian receptor analogs, respectively. These structures provide a structural basis for the different receptor-binding properties of influenza A and B virus HA molecules and for the ability of influenza B virus HA to distinguish human and avian receptors. The structure of influenza B virus HA with avian receptor analog also reveals how mutations in the region of residues 194 to 196, which are frequently observed in egg-adapted and naturally occurring variants, directly affect the receptor binding of the resultant virus strains. Furthermore, these structures of influenza B virus HA are compared with known structures of influenza A virus HAs, which suggests the role of the residue at 222 as a key and likely a universal determinant for the different binding modes of human receptor analogs by different HA molecules.},

abstract = {An understanding of how broadly neutralizing activity develops in HIV-1-infected individuals is needed to guide vaccine design and immunization strategies. Here we used a large panel of 44 HIV-1 envelope variants (subtypes A, B, and C) to evaluate the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies in serum samples obtained 3 years after seroconversion from 40 women enrolled in the CAPRISA 002 acute infection cohort. Seven of 40 participants had serum antibodies that neutralized more than 40% of viruses tested and were considered to have neutralization breadth. Among the samples with breadth, CAP257 serum neutralized 82% (36/44 variants) of the panel, while CAP256 serum neutralized 77% (33/43 variants) of the panel. Analysis of longitudinal samples showed that breadth developed gradually starting from year 2, with the number of viruses neutralized as well as the antibody titer increasing over time. Interestingly, neutralization breadth peaked at 4 years postinfection, with no increase thereafter. The extent of cross-neutralizing activity correlated with CD4(+) T cell decline, viral load, and CD4(+) T cell count at 6 months postinfection but not at later time points, suggesting that early events set the stage for the development of breadth. However, in a multivariate analysis, CD4 decline was the major driver of this association, as viral load was not an independent predictor of breadth. Mapping of the epitopes targeted by cross-neutralizing antibodies revealed that in one individual these antibodies recognized the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), while in two other individuals, cross-neutralizing activity was adsorbed by monomeric gp120 and targeted epitopes that involved the N-linked glycan at position 332 in the C3 region. Serum antibodies from the other four participants targeted quaternary epitopes, at least 2 of which were PG9/16-like and depended on the N160 and/or L165 residue in the V2 region. These data indicate that fewer than 20% of HIV-1 subtype C-infected individuals develop antibodies with cross-neutralizing activity after 3 years of infection and that these antibodies target different regions of the HIV-1 envelope, including as yet uncharacterized epitopes.},

The region contains 123 VH segments classifiable into seven different families, of which 79 are pseudogenes. Of the 44 VH segments with an open reading frame, 39 are expressed as heavy chain proteins and 1 as mRNA, while the remaining 4 are not found in immunoglobulin cDNAs. Combinatorial diversity of VH region was calculated to be approximately 6,000. Conservation of the promoter and recombination signal sequences was observed to be higher in functional VH segments than in pseudogenes. Phylogenetic analysis of 114 VH segments clearly showed clustering of the VH segments of each family. However, an independent branch in the tree contained a single VH, V4-44.1P, sharing similar levels of homology to human VH families and to those of other vertebrates. Comparison between different copies of homologous units that appear repeatedly across the locus clearly demonstrates that dynamic DNA reorganization of the locus took place at least eight times between 133 and 10 million years ago. One nonimmunoglobulin gene of unknown function was identified in the intergenic region.},

A fourth fragment of 7.4 kb was found in addition to these three fragments in similarly digested total DNA from a $\lambda$ chain-secreting myeloma (HOPC 2020). We have cloned the four DNA fragments in an EK-2 phage vector, $\lambda$
						WES and characterized them with respect to size, type of $\lambda$ gene sequences contained and position of these sequences in the fragments, using agarose gel electrophoresis, the gel blotting technique and electron microscopic R loop mapping. The embryonic DNA clones Ig 99$\lambda$, Ig 25$\lambda$ and Ig 13$\lambda$ contain one copy each of V
						$\lambda$l, C
						$\lambda$I and V
						$\lambda$lI sequences, respectively, while the myeloma DNA clone Ig 303$\lambda$ contains one copy each of V
						$\lambda$I, and C
						$\lambda$I sequences that are separated by a 1.2 kb nontranslated DNA segment. Ig 25$\lambda$ was also shown to contain a DNA segment of approximately 40 base pairs (bp) (J sequence) that lies 1.2 kb away from the Ca
						$\lambda$I sequence and is homologous to the V-C junction region of a $\lambda$
						I mRNA. Heteroduplex analysis of the three $\lambda$
						I DNA clones revealed that Ig 303$\lambda$ DNA is composed of two parts, one of which is entirely homologous to one end of Ig 99$\lambda$, and the other to one end of Ig 25$\lambda$ DNA. The sequence arrangement observed in the cloned DNA is the same as that in the corresponding cellular DNA. This was shown by identifying certain restriction enzyme cleavage sites on the cloned DNAs and demonstrating the presence of these sites in the total cellular DNA by the gel blotting technique. The site of the homology switch is at the boundary of the V sequence and the 1.2 kb nontranslated DNA segment, and corresponds to the position of the J sequence on the Ig 25$\lambda$ DNA. We consider the above experimental results the most direct evidence for somatic rearrangement in immunoglobulin genes. We discuss the significance of these findings for the origin of genes in the evolution of higher organisms and in cell differentiation.},

Attached to JH3 in the cloned DNA, in inverted sequence, is the DNA from JH1 to the JH2 recognition sequence. The inverted segment is attached at its other end to the 5' recognition sequence of a diversity segment (D). To form this structure, three joining events must have occurred on the same chromosome. One of these events could have been a normal D-JH joining but the others must have been irregular events including ones that result in inversions. One of the joining events left fused recognition elements from JH2 and a D whose sequence shows that, during joining, reciprocal joinings of the recognition elements must occur to fuse the heptameric elements back to back. Because joined D and JH undergo deletion of terminal coding sequence during recombination but the joined heptameric recognition sequences do not contain the deleted sequence, joining must be a nonreciprocal event. Also, extra nucleotides are inserted between D and JH as part of the joining process; it is suggested that this added sequence is a product of the activity of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase at the D/JH (and probably the VH/D) joints and that it represents a new element of heavy chain gene structure, the N region.},

abstract = {By experimenting with a cellular automaton model of the immune system, we have reproduced affinity maturation of the antibody response, a somatic adaptation to a changing environment. The simulation allowed the isolation of a number of variables, e.g. the fraction of repertoire available, the magnitude of the change in affinity with mutation, the mutation frequency and its focus on the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of the antibody. Multiple series of immunizations were run in machina where the contribution of each variable was evaluated against the maturation observed. We found that hypermutation is not necessary for affinity maturation if the repertoire of B cell specificities is sufficiently complete, but is essential when the B cell diversity is limited (which happens to be the case in vivo), as it fills the holes in the repertoire and allows selection by antigen. Maturation also depends on the magnitude of the change in affinity with mutation, and we supply some necessary limits on this parameter. For mutations confined to the CDR, the most efficient maturation occurs at mutation rates of 0.2 per paratope and per cell division. When mutations also affect the framework regions, the peak of the most effective CDR mutation rate moves progressively to lower values. A most sensitive parameter is the speed of maturation, which reflects the rate of expansion of mutated clones. Comparing it with biological observations can help to discriminate between alternative hypotheses on the phenomena of hypermutation and affinity.},

All patients were anergic and lymphopenic; they had no lymphocyte proliferative responses to soluble antigens, and their responses to phytohemagglutinin were markedly reduced. Monoclonal-antibody analysis of peripheral-blood T-cell subpopulations revealed virtual elimination of the Leu-3 / helper/inducer subset, an increased percentage of the Leu-2 + suppressor/cytoxic subset, and an increased percentage of cells bearing the thymocyte-associated antigen T10. The inversion of the T/ helper to suppressor/cytotoxic ratio suggested that cytomegalovirus infection was an important factor in the pathogenesis of the immunodeficient state. A high level of exposure of male homosexuals to cytomegalovirus-infected secretions may account for the occurrence of this immune deficiency.},

In contrast to other structurally characterized influenza antibodies, CR6261 recognizes a highly conserved helical region in the membrane-proximal stem of HA1 and HA2. The antibody neutralizes the virus by blocking conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion.

Antibodies from serum of this patient react with proteins from viruses of the HTLV-I subgroup, but type-specific antisera to HTLV-I do not precipitate proteins of the new isolate. The virus from this patient has been transmitted into cord blood lymphocytes, and the virus produced by these cells is similar to the original isolate. From these studies it is concluded that this virus as well as the previous HTLV isolates belong to a general family of T-lymphotropic retroviruses that are horizontally transmitted in humans and may be involved in several pathological syndromes, including AIDS.},

abstract = {The targets of broadly cross-neutralizing (BCN) antibodies are of great interest in the HIV vaccine field. We have identified a subtype C HIV-1-superinfected individual, CAP256, with high-level BCN activity, and characterized the antibody specificity mediating breadth. CAP256 developed potent BCN activity peaking at 3 years postinfection, neutralizing 32 (76%) of 42 heterologous viruses, with titers of antibodies against some viruses exceeding 1:10,000. CAP256 showed a subtype bias, preferentially neutralizing subtype C and A viruses over subtype B viruses. CAP256 BCN serum targeted a quaternary epitope which included the V1V2 region. Further mapping identified residues F159, N160, L165, R166, D167, K169, and K171 (forming the FN/LRD-K-K motif) in the V2 region as crucial to the CAP256 epitope. However, the fine specificity of the BCN response varied over time and, while consistently dependent on R166 and K169, became gradually less dependent on D167 and K171, possibly contributing to the incremental increase in breadth over 4 years. The presence of an intact FN/LRD-K-K motif in heterologous viruses was associated with sensitivity, although the length of the adjacent V1 loop modulated the degree of sensitivity, with a shorter V1 region significantly associated with higher titers. Repair of the FN/LRD-K-K motif in resistant heterologous viruses conferred sensitivity, with titers sometimes exceeding 1:10,000. Comparison of the CAP256 epitope with that of the PG9/PG16 monoclonal antibodies suggested that these epitopes overlapped, adding to the mounting evidence that this may represent a common neutralization target that should be further investigated as a potential vaccine candidate.},

abstract = {A protective vaccine against HIV-1 will likely require the elicitation of a broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) response. Although the development of an immunogen that elicits such antibodies remains elusive, a proportion of HIV-1 infected individuals evolve broadly neutralizing serum responses over time, demonstrating that the human immune system can recognize and generate NAbs to conserved epitopes on the virus. Understanding the specificities that mediate broad neutralization will provide insight into which epitopes should be targeted for immunogen design and aid in the isolation of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from these donors. Here, we have used a number of new and established technologies to map the bNAb specificities in the sera of 19 donors who exhibit among the most potent cross-clade serum neutralizing activities observed to date. The results suggest that broad and potent serum neutralization arises in most donors through a limited number of specificities (1-2 per donor). The major targets recognized are an epitope defined by the bNAbs PG9 and PG16 that is associated with conserved regions of the V1, V2 and V3 loops, an epitope overlapping the CD4 binding site and possibly the coreceptor binding site, an epitope sensitive to a loss of the glycan at N332 and distinct from that recognized by the bNAb 2G12 and an epitope sensitive to an I165A substitution. In approximately half of the donors, key N-linked glycans were critical for expression of the epitopes recognized by the bNAb specificities in the sera.},

abstract = {The characterization of the cross-reactive, or heterologous, neutralizing antibody responses developed during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the identification of factors associated with their generation are relevant to the development of an HIV vaccine. We report that in healthy HIV-positive, antiretroviral-na{\"\i}ve subjects, the breadth of plasma heterologous neutralizing antibody responses correlates with the time since infection, plasma viremia levels, and the binding avidity of anti-Env antibodies. Anti-CD4-binding site antibodies are responsible for the exceptionally broad cross-neutralizing antibody responses recorded only in rare plasma samples. However, in most cases examined, antibodies to the variable regions and to the CD4-binding site of Env modestly contributed in defining the overall breadth of these responses. Plasmas with broad cross-neutralizing antibody responses were identified that targeted the gp120 subunit, but their precise epitopes mapped outside the variable regions and the CD4-binding site. Finally, although several plasmas were identified with cross-neutralizing antibody responses that were not directed against gp120, only one plasma with a moderate breadth of heterologous neutralizing antibody responses contained cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against the 4E10 epitope, which is within the gp41 transmembrane subunit. Overall, our study indicates that more than one pathway leads to the development of broad cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies during HIV infection and that the virus continuously escapes their action.},

However, little is known about the specificity and activity of these antibodies. To characterize the memory antibody responses to HIV, we cloned 502 antibodies from HIV envelope-binding memory B cells from six HIV-infected patients with broadly neutralizing antibodies and low to intermediate viral loads. We show that in these patients, the B-cell memory response to gp140 is composed of up to 50 independent clones expressing high affinity neutralizing antibodies to the gp120 variable loops, the CD4-binding site, the co-receptor-binding site, and to a new neutralizing epitope that is in the same region of gp120 as the CD4-binding site. Thus, the IgG memory B-cell compartment in the selected group of patients with broad serum neutralizing activity to HIV is comprised of multiple clonal responses with neutralizing activity directed against several epitopes on gp120.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The isolation of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize a broad spectrum of primary HIV-1 isolates and the characterization of the human neutralizing antibody B cell response to HIV-1 infection are important goals that are central to the design of an effective antibody-based vaccine.

METHODS AND FINDINGS:We immortalized IgG(+) memory B cells from individuals infected with diverse clades of HIV-1 and selected on the basis of plasma neutralization profiles that were cross-clade and relatively potent. Culture supernatants were screened using various recombinant forms of the envelope glycoproteins (Env) in multiple parallel assays. We isolated 58 mAbs that were mapped to different Env surfaces, most of which showed neutralizing activity. One mAb in particular (HJ16) specific for a novel epitope proximal to the CD4 binding site on gp120 selectively neutralized a multi-clade panel of Tier-2 HIV-1 pseudoviruses, and demonstrated reactivity that was comparable in breadth, but distinct in neutralization specificity, to that of the other CD4 binding site-specific neutralizing mAb b12. A second mAb (HGN194) bound a conserved epitope in the V3 crown and neutralized all Tier-1 and a proportion of Tier-2 pseudoviruses tested, irrespective of clade. A third mAb (HK20) with broad neutralizing activity, particularly as a Fab fragment, recognized a highly conserved epitope in the HR-1 region of gp41, but showed striking assay-dependent selectivity in its activity.

CONCLUSIONS:This study reveals that by using appropriate screening methods, a large proportion of memory B cells can be isolated that produce mAbs with HIV-1 neutralizing activity. Three of these mAbs show unusual breadth of neutralization and therefore add to the current panel of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies with potential for passive protection and template-based vaccine design.},

Thus far, however, few broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies that occur naturally have been characterized.

All four individuals produced expanded clones of potent broadly neutralizing CD4-binding-site antibodies that mimic binding to CD4. Despite extensive hypermutation, the new antibodies shared a consensus sequence of 68 immunoglobulin H (IgH) chain amino acids and arise independently from two related IgH genes.

To determine the autoantibody nature of these Abs, we have compared their reactivities with human anti-cardiolipin mAbs derived from a primary antiphospholipid syndrome patient. To define the role of lipid polyreactivity in binding of 2F5 and 4E10 mAbs to HIV-1 envelope membrane proximal epitopes, we determined the kinetics of binding of mAbs 2F5 and 4E10 to their nominal gp41 epitopes vs liposome-gp41 peptide conjugates. Both anti-HIV-1 mAbs 2F5 and 4E10 bound to cardiolipin with K(d) values similar to those of autoimmune anti-cardiolipin Abs, IS4 and IS6. Binding kinetics studies revealed that mAb 2F5 and 4E10 binding to their respective gp41 peptide-lipid conjugates could best be defined by a two-step (encounter-docking) conformational change model. In contrast, binding of 2F5 and 4E10 mAbs to linear peptide epitopes followed a simple Langmuir model. A mouse mAb, 13H11, that cross-blocks mAb 2F5 binding to the gp41 epitope did not cross-react with lipids nor did it neutralize HIV-1 viruses. Taken together, these data demonstrate the similarity of 2F5 and 4E10 mAbs to known anti-cardiolipin Abs and support the model that mAb 2F5 and 4E10 binding to HIV-1 involves both viral lipid membrane and gp41 membrane proximal epitopes.},

Here we demonstrate that the two most broadly reactive HIV-1 envelope gp41 human mAbs, 2F5 and 4E10, are polyspecific autoantibodies reactive with the phospholipid cardiolipin. Thus, current HIV-1 vaccines may not induce these types of antibodies because of autoantigen mimicry of the conserved membrane-proximal epitopes of the virus.

abstract = {The identification and epitope mapping of broadly neutralizing anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibodies (Abs) is important for vaccine design, but, despite much effort, very few such Abs have been forthcoming. Only one broadly neutralizing anti-gp41 monoclonal Ab (MAb), 2F5, has been described. Here we report on two MAbs that recognize a region immediately C-terminal of the 2F5 epitope. Both MAbs were generated from HIV-1-seropositive donors, one (Z13) from an antibody phage display library, and one (4E10) as a hybridoma. Both MAbs recognize a predominantly linear and relatively conserved epitope, compete with each other for binding to synthetic peptide derived from gp41, and bind to HIV-1(MN) virions. By flow cytometry, these MAbs appear to bind relatively weakly to infected cells and this binding is not perturbed by pretreatment of the infected cells with soluble CD4. Despite the apparent linear nature of the epitopes of Z13 and 4E10, denaturation of recombinant envelope protein reduces the binding of these MAbs, suggesting some conformational requirements for full epitope expression. Most significantly, Z13 and 4E10 are able to neutralize selected primary isolates from diverse subtypes of HIV-1 (e.g., subtypes B, C, and E). The results suggest that a rather extensive region of gp41 close to the transmembrane domain is accessible to neutralizing Abs and could form a useful target for vaccine design.},

All reactions are performed in 96-well plates and allow cloning of large numbers of Ig genes. The recombinant antibodies are tested for reactivity with diverse self- and non-self antigens and the reactivity profile can be directly linked to the complete Ig heavy and Ig light chain gene sequence information that is obtained as part of the cloning strategy. In summary, our method to clone and express human monoclonal antibodies is unbiased, highly efficient, requires only small cell numbers and the recombinant antibodies allow direct conclusions on the frequency of specific human B cells in a diverse repertoire.},

abstract = {During B lymphocyte development, antibodies are assembled by random gene segment reassortment to produce a vast number of specificities. A potential disadvantage of this process is that some of the antibodies produced are self-reactive. We determined the prevalence of self-reactive antibody formation and its regulation in human B cells. A majority (55 to 75%) of all antibodies expressed by early immature B cells displayed self-reactivity, including polyreactive and anti-nuclear specificities. Most of these autoantibodies were removed from the population at two discrete checkpoints during B cell development. Inefficient checkpoint regulation would lead to substantial increases in circulating autoantibodies.},

abstract = {The vast repertoire of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors is generated, in part, by V(D)J recombination, a series of genomic rearrangements that occur specifically in developing lymphocytes. The recombination activating gene, RAG-1, which is a gene expressed exclusively in maturing lymphoid cells, was previously isolated. RAG-1 inefficiently induced V(D)J recombinase activity when transfected into fibroblasts, but cotransfection with an adjacent gene, RAG-2, has resulted in at least a 1000-fold increase in the frequency of recombination. The 2.1-kilobase RAG-2 complementary DNA encodes a putative protein of 527 amino acids whose sequence is unrelated to that of RAG-1. Like RAG-1, RAG-2 is conserved between species that carry out V(D)J recombination, and its expression pattern correlates precisely with that of V(D)J recombinase activity. In addition to being located just 8 kilobases apart, these convergently transcribed genes are unusual in that most, if not all, of their coding and 3' untranslated sequences are contained in single exons. RAG-1 and RAG-2 might activate the expression of the V(D)J recombinase but, more likely, they directly participate in the recombination reaction.},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

In the current study, we introduced deglycosylations into the 24 N-linked glycosylation sites of a R5 env MWS2 cloned from semen and systematically analyzed the impact on infectivity, antigenicity, immunogenicity and sensitivity to entry inhibitors. We found that mutants N156-T158A, N197-S199A, N262-S264A and N410-T412A conferred decreased infectivity and enhanced sensitivity to a series of antibodies and entry inhibitors. When mice were immunized with the DNA of wild-type or mutated gp160, gp140 or gp120; N156-T158A, N262-S264A and N410-T412A were more effective in inducing neutralizing activity against wild-type MWS2 as well as heterologous IIIB and CH811 Envs. In general, gp160 and gp140 induced higher neutralizing activity compared with gp120. Our study demonstrates for the first time that removal of individual glycan N156, N262 or N410 proximal to CD4-binding region impairs viral infectivity and results in enhanced capability to induce neutralizing activity.},

In this review we describe similarities, both in structural terms and sequence determinants of their TM and juxtamembrane regions. The TM domains are essential not only for anchoring the proteins in membranes but also have functional roles. Both TM segments contain GxxxG motifs that drive TM associations within the lipid bilayer. They also each possess similar sequence motifs, positioned at the membrane interface preceding their TM domains. These domains are known as cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif in gp41 and CRAC-like motif in APP. Moreover, in the cytoplasmic domain of both proteins other alpha-helical membranotropic regions with functional implications have been identified. Recent drug developments targeting both diseases are reviewed and the potential use of TM interaction modulators as therapeutic targets is discussed.},

We discuss in detail how to identify frequent patterns in a protein sequence database using a level-wise search technique, how to define a set of features from those patterns and how to use those features in the prediction of the secondary structure of a protein sequence using support vector machines (SVMs).

RESULTS:Three different sets of features based on frequent patterns are evaluated in a blind testing setup using 150 targets from the EVA contest and compared to predictions of PSI-PRED, PHD and PROFsec. Despite being trained on only 940 proteins, a simple SVM classifier based on this new representation yields results comparable to PSI-PRED and PROFsec. Finally, we show that the method contributes significant information to consensus predictions.

AVAILABILITY:The method is available from the authors upon request.},

abstract = {In complex systems with many degrees of freedom such as peptides and proteins, there exists a huge number of local-minimum-energy states. Conventional simulations in the canonical ensemble are of little use, because they tend to get trapped in states of these energy local minima. A simulation in generalized ensemble performs a random walk in potential energy space and can overcome this difficulty. From only one simulation run, one can obtain canonical-ensemble averages of physical quantities as functions of temperature by the single-histogram and/or multiple-histogram reweighting techniques. In this article we review uses of the generalized-ensemble algorithms in biomolecular systems. Three well-known methods, namely, multicanonical algorithm, simulated tempering, and replica-exchange method, are described first. Both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics versions of the algorithms are given. We then present three new generalized-ensemble algorithms that combine the merits of the above methods. The effectiveness of the methods for molecular simulations in the protein folding problem is tested with short peptide systems.},

Good folding sequences have a landscape that resembles a rough funnel where the energy bias towards the native state is larger than its ruggedness. Such a landscape leads not only to fast folding and stable native conformations but, more importantly, to sequences that are robust to variations in the protein environment and to sequence mutations. In this paper, an off-lattice model of sequences that fold into a beta-barrel native structure is used to describe a framework that can quantitatively distinguish good and bad folders. The two sequences analyzed have the same native structure, but one of them is minimally frustrated whereas the other one exhibits a high degree of frustration.},

abstract = {Combinatorial antibody libraries have the potential to display the entire immunological record of an individual, allowing one to detect and recover any antibody ever made, irrespective of whether it is currently being produced. We have termed this the "fossil record" of an individual's antibody response. To determine whether cancer patients have ever made antibodies with disease-fighting potential, we screened combinatorial antibody libraries from cancer patients for immunoglobulins that can identify metastatic tumor cells. This strategy yielded human antibodies specific for the activated conformation of the adhesion receptor integrin alphavbeta3 that is associated with a metastatic phenotype. In a remarkable example of convergent evolution, two of these antibodies were shown to contain the Arg-Gly-Asp integrin recognition motif of the natural ligand within the third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain. These antibodies interfered with lung colonization by human breast cancer cells in a mouse model and inhibited existing metastatic disease. Our data imply that, at least at some time, these antibodies were part of a patient's surveillance system against metastatic cells, targeting the activated conformer of integrin alphavbeta3 and disrupting its functions. The ligand-mimetic nature of these antibodies, combined with specificity for a single receptor, is unique in the integrin-ligand repertoire. The convergent evolution of critical sequences in antibodies and other ligands that bind to the same target means that the immune response has sufficient power to find a best chemical solution for the optimization of binding energy, even though antibodies evolve in real time, as compared with billions of years for the natural ligand.},

abstract = {Select HIV-1-infected individuals develop sera capable of neutralizing diverse viral strains. The molecular basis of this neutralization is currently being deciphered by the isolation of HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies. In one infected donor, three neutralizing antibodies, PGT135-137, were identified by assessment of neutralization from individually sorted B cells and found to recognize an epitope containing an N-linked glycan at residue 332 on HIV-1 gp120. Here we use deep sequencing and bioinformatics methods to interrogate the B cell record of this donor to gain a more complete understanding of the humoral immune response. PGT135-137-gene family-specific primers were used to amplify heavy and light chain-variable domain sequences. 454 pyrosequencing produced 141,298 heavy-chain sequences of IGHV4-39 origin and 87,229 light-chain sequences of IGKV3-15 origin. A number of heavy and light chain sequences of ~90% identity to PGT137, several to PGT136, and none of high identity to PGT135 were identified. After expansion of these sequences to include close phylogenetic relatives, a total of 202 heavy-chain sequences and 72 light-chain sequences were identified. These sequences were clustered into populations of 95% identity comprising 15 for heavy chain and 10 for light chain, and a select sequence from each population was synthesized and reconstituted with a PGT137-partner chain. Reconstituted antibodies showed varied neutralization phenotypes for HIV-1 clade A and D isolates. Sequence diversity of the antibody population represented by these tested sequences was notably higher than observed with a 454 pyrosequencing-control analysis on 10 antibodies of defined sequence, suggesting that this diversity results primarily from somatic maturation. Our results thus provide an example of how pathogens like HIV-1 are opposed by a varied humoral immune response, derived from intrinsic mechanisms of antibody development, and embodied by somatic populations of diverse antibodies.},

abstract = {High resolution structures of antibody-antigen complexes are useful for analyzing the binding interface and to make rational choices for antibody engineering. When a crystallographic structure of a complex is unavailable, the structure must be predicted using computational tools. In this work, we illustrate a novel approach, named SnugDock, to predict high-resolution antibody-antigen complex structures by simultaneously structurally optimizing the antibody-antigen rigid-body positions, the relative orientation of the antibody light and heavy chains, and the conformations of the six complementarity determining region loops. This approach is especially useful when the crystal structure of the antibody is not available, requiring allowances for inaccuracies in an antibody homology model which would otherwise frustrate rigid-backbone docking predictions. Local docking using SnugDock with the lowest-energy RosettaAntibody homology model produced more accurate predictions than standard rigid-body docking. SnugDock can be combined with ensemble docking to mimic conformer selection and induced fit resulting in increased sampling of diverse antibody conformations. The combined algorithm produced four medium (Critical Assessment of PRediction of Interactions-CAPRI rating) and seven acceptable lowest-interface-energy predictions in a test set of fifteen complexes. Structural analysis shows that diverse paratope conformations are sampled, but docked paratope backbones are not necessarily closer to the crystal structure conformations than the starting homology models. The accuracy of SnugDock predictions suggests a new genre of general docking algorithms with flexible binding interfaces targeted towards making homology models useful for further high-resolution predictions.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: PyRosetta is a stand-alone Python-based implementation of the Rosetta molecular modeling package that allows users to write custom structure prediction and design algorithms using the major Rosetta sampling and scoring functions. PyRosetta contains Python bindings to libraries that define Rosetta functions including those for accessing and manipulating protein structure, calculating energies and running Monte Carlo-based simulations. PyRosetta can be used in two ways: (i) interactively, using iPython and (ii) script-based, using Python scripting. Interactive mode contains a number of help features and is ideal for beginners while script-mode is best suited for algorithm development. PyRosetta has similar computational performance to Rosetta, can be easily scaled up for cluster applications and has been implemented for algorithms demonstrating protein docking, protein folding, loop modeling and design. AVAILABILITY: PyRosetta is a stand-alone package available at http://www.pyrosetta.org under the Rosetta license which is free for academic and non-profit users. A tutorial, user's manual and sample scripts demonstrating usage are also available on the web site.},

We provide a brief review of the six most frequent research problems tackled with Rosetta. For each of these six tasks, we provide a tutorial that illustrates a basic Rosetta protocol. The Rosetta method was originally developed for de novo protein structure prediction and is regularly one of the best performers in the community-wide biennial Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction. Predictions for protein domains with fewer than 125 amino acids regularly have a backbone root-mean-square deviation of better than 5.0 A. More impressively, there are several cases in which Rosetta has been used to predict structures with atomic level accuracy better than 2.5 A. In addition to de novo structure prediction, Rosetta also has methods for molecular docking, homology modeling, determining protein structures from sparse experimental NMR or EPR data, and protein design. Rosetta has been used to accurately design a novel protein structure, predict the structure of protein-protein complexes, design altered specificity protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and stabilize proteins and protein complexes. Most recently, Rosetta has been used to solve the X-ray crystallographic phase problem.},

abstract = {HIV-1 particles are decorated with a network of densely arranged envelope spikes on their surface. Each spike is formed of a trimer of heterodimers of the gp120 surface and the gp41 transmembrane glycoproteins. These molecules mediate HIV-1 entry into target cells, initiating the HIV-1 replication cycle. They are a target for entry-blocking drugs and for neutralizing Abs that could contribute to vaccine protection. The crystal structure of the core of gp120 has been recently solved. It reveals the structure of the conserved HIV-1 receptor binding sites and some of the mechanisms evolved by HIV-1 to escape Ab responses. The gp120 consists of three faces. One is largely inaccessible on the native trimer, and two faces are exposed but apparently have low immunogenicity, particularly on primary viruses. We have modeled HIV-1 neutralization by a CD4 binding site monoclonal Ab, and we propose that neutralization takes place by inhibition of the interaction between gp120 and the target cell membrane receptors as a result of steric hindrance. Knowledge of gp120 structure and function should assist in the design of new drugs as well as of an effective vaccine. In the latter case, circumventing the low immunogenicity of the HIV-1 envelope spike is a major challenge.},

A comparison between HIV and influenza virus illustrates the extraordinary scale of HIV variation, and underscores the importance of exploring innovative HIV vaccine strategies. Deeper understanding of the implications of variation for both antibody and T-cell responses may help in the effort to rationally design vaccines that stimulate broad cross-reactivity.

Antibodies directed at the 2F5 epitope have neutralizing effects on a broad range of laboratory-adapted HIV-1 variants and primary isolates.

The crystal structure of Fab 4E10 was determined at 2.2 A resolution in complex with a 13-residue peptide containing the gp41 core epitope (NWFDIT). The bound peptide adopts a helical conformation in which the key contact residues, TrpP672, PheP673, IleP675, and ThrP676, map to one face of the helix. The peptide binds in a hydrophobic pocket that may emulate its potential interaction with the host cell membrane. The long CDR H3 of the antibody extends beyond the bound peptide in an orientation that suggests that its apex could contact the viral membrane when 4E10 is bound to its membrane-proximal epitope. These structural insights should assist in the design of immunogens to elicit 4E10-like neutralizing responses.},

abstract = {An essential requirement for theoretical protein structure prediction is an energy function that can discriminate the native from non-native protein conformations. To date most of the energy functions used for this purpose have been extracted from a statistical analysis of the protein structure database, without explicit reference to the physical interactions responsible for protein stability. The use of the statistical functions has been supported by the widespread belief that they are superior for such discrimination to physics-based energy functions. An effective energy function which combined the CHARMM vacuum potential with a Gaussian model for the solvation free energy is tested for its ability to discriminate the native structure of a protein from misfolded conformations; the results are compared with those obtained with the vacuum CHARMM potential. The test is performed on several sets of misfolded structures prepared by others, including sets of about 650 good decoys for six proteins, as well as on misfolded structures of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. The vacuum CHARMM potential is successful in most cases when energy minimized conformations are considered, but fails when applied to structures relaxed by molecular dynamics. With the effective energy function the native state is always more stable than grossly misfolded conformations both in energy minimized and molecular dynamics-relaxed structures. The present results suggest that molecular mechanics (physics-based) energy functions, complemented by a simple model for the solvation free energy, should be tested for use in the inverse folding problem, and supports their use in studies of the effective energy surface of proteins in solution. Moreover, the study suggests that the belief in the superiority of statistical functions for these purposes may be ill founded.},

abstract = {A backbone-dependent rotamer library for amino acid side-chains is developed and used for constructing protein side-chain conformations from the main-chain co-ordinates. The rotamer library is obtained from 132 protein chains in the Brookhaven Protein Database. A grid of 20 degrees by 20 degrees blocks for the main-chain angles phi, psi is used in the rotamer library. Significant correlations are found between side-chain dihedral angle probabilities and backbone phi, psi values. These probabilities are used to place the side-chains on the known backbone in test applications for six proteins for which high-resolution crystal structures are available. A minimization scheme is used to reorient side-chains that conflict with the backbone or other side-chains after the initial placement. The initial placement yields 59% of both chi 1 and chi 2 values in the correct position (to within 40 degrees) for thermolysin to 81% for crambin. After refinement the values range from 61% (lysozyme) to 89% (crambin). It is evident from the results that a single protein does not adequately test a prediction scheme. The computation time required by the method scales linearly with the number of side-chains. An initial prediction from the library takes only a few seconds of computer time, while the iterative refinement takes on the order of hours. The method is automated and can easily be applied to aid experimental side-chain determinations and homology modeling. The high degree of correlation between backbone and side-chain conformations may introduce a simplification in the protein folding process by reducing the available conformational space.},

abstract = {We describe predictions made using the Rosetta structure prediction methodology for the Eighth Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction. Aggressive sampling and all-atom refinement were carried out for nearly all targets. A combination of alignment methodologies was used to generate starting models from a range of templates, and the models were then subjected to Rosetta all atom refinement. For the 64 domains with readily identified templates, the best submitted model was better than the best alignment to the best template in the Protein Data Bank for 24 cases, and improved over the best starting model for 43 cases. For 13 targets where only very distant sequence relationships to proteins of known structure were detected, models were generated using the Rosetta de novo structure prediction methodology followed by all-atom refinement; in several cases the submitted models were better than those based on the available templates. Of the 12 refinement challenges, the best submitted model improved on the starting model in seven cases. These improvements over the starting template-based models and refinement tests demonstrate the power of Rosetta structure refinement in improving model accuracy.},

abstract = {The physical basis for high-affinity interactions involving proteins is complex and potentially involves a range of energetic contributions. Among these are changes in protein conformational entropy, which cannot yet be reliably computed from molecular structures. We have recently used changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for changes in conformational entropy of calmodulin upon association with domains from regulated proteins. The apparent change in conformational entropy was linearly related to the overall binding entropy. This view warrants a more quantitative foundation. Here we calibrate an 'entropy meter' using an experimental dynamical proxy based on NMR relaxation and show that changes in the conformational entropy of calmodulin are a significant component of the energetics of binding. Furthermore, the distribution of motion at the interface between the target domain and calmodulin is surprisingly noncomplementary. These observations promote modification of our understanding of the energetics of protein-ligand interactions.},

Interestingly, however, the three Abs exhibit similar complementarity-determining region conformations in the Ag binding site while recognizing the common epitope, indicating that different pathways of binding are used for Ag recognition. The epitope also exhibits conformational similarity when bound to each of these Abs, although the peptide Ag was otherwise flexible.

Four high quality, chemically synthesized polynucleotides (90-140 bases) were annealed and extended using T4 DNA polymerase. Following electroporation, >10(9) transformants could be synthesized within 1 day. Fusion to beta-lactamase and selection on ampicillin resulted in 3.7 x 10(8) V(H) and 6.9 x 10(8) V(kappa) clones highly enriched for full-length, in-frame genes. High-throughput 454 DNA sequencing of >250,000 V(H) and V(kappa) genes from the pre- and post-selection libraries revealed that, in addition to the expected reduction in reading-frame shifts and stop codons, selection for functional expression also resulted in a statistical decrease in the cysteine content. Apart from these differences, there was a good agreement between the expected and actual diversity, indicating that neither oligonucleotide synthesis nor biological constrains due to protein synthesis of V(H)/V(kappa)-beta-lactamase fusions introduce biases in the amino acid composition of the randomized regions. This methodology can be employed for the rapid construction of highly diverse libraries with the near elimination of PCR errors in invariant regions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In pandemic and epidemic forms, avian and human influenza viruses often cause significant damage to human society and economics. Gradually accumulated mutations on hemagglutinin (HA) cause immunologically distinct circulating strains, which lead to the antigenic drift (named as antigenic variants). The "antigenic variants" often requires a new vaccine to be formulated before each annual epidemic. Mapping the genetic evolution to the antigenic drift of influenza viruses is an emergent issue to public health and vaccine development RESULTS: We developed a method for identifying antigenic critical amino acid positions, rules, and co-mutated positions for antigenic variants. The information gain (IG) and the entropy are used to measure the score of an amino acid position on hemagglutinin (HA) for discriminating between antigenic variants and similar viruses. A position with high IG and entropy implied that this position is highly correlated to an antigenic drift. Nineteen positions with high IG and high genetic diversity are identified as antigenic critical positions on the HA proteins. Most of these antigenic critical positions are located on five epitopes or on the surface based on the HA structure. Based on IG values and entropies of these 19 positions on the HA, the decision tree was applied to create a rule-based model and to identify rules for predicting antigenic variants of a given two HA sequences which are often a vaccine strain and a circulating strain. The predicting accuracies of this model on two sets, which consist of a training set (181 hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays) and an independent test set (31,878 HI assays), are 91.2% and 96.2% respectively. CONCLUSION: Our method is able to identify critical positions, rules, and co-mutated positions on HA for predicting the antigenic variants. The information gains and the entropies of HA positions provide insight to the antigenic drift and co-evolution positions for influenza seasons. We believe that our method is robust and is potential useful for studying influenza virus evolution and vaccine development.},

We show that the repertoire of IgM(+)IgD(+)CD27(+) B cells in the spleen and blood displays no sign of antigen-driven activation and expansion on H-CDR3 spectratyping, despite the many antigenic challenges provided by childhood vaccinations. This repertoire differed markedly from those of switched B cells and splenic germinal center B cells, even at the early stage of differentiation associated with mu heavy chain expression. These data provide evidence for the developmental diversification of IgM(+)IgD(+)CD27(+) B cells, at least in very young children, outside of T cell-dependent and -independent immune responses.},

abstract = {Several human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) including b12, 2G12, and 2F5 exhibit relatively potent and broad HIV-1-neutralizing activity. However, their elicitation in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. We have hypothesized that HIV-1 has evolved a strategy to reduce or eliminate the immunogenicity of the highly conserved epitopes of such antibodies by using "holes" (absence or very weak binding to these epitopes of germline antibodies that is not sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an efficient immune response) in the human germline B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire. To begin to test this hypothesis we have designed germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to b12, 2G12, and 2F5 as well as to X5, m44, and m46 which are cross-reactive but with relatively modest neutralizing activity as natively occurring antibodies due to size and/or other effects. The germline-like X5, m44, and m46 bound with relatively high affinity to all tested Envs. In contrast, germline-like b12, 2G12, and 2F5 lacked measurable binding to Envs in an ELISA assay although the corresponding mature antibodies did. These results provide initial evidence that Env structures containing conserved vulnerable epitopes may not initiate humoral responses by binding to germline antibodies. Even if such responses are initiated by very weak binding undetectable in our assay it is likely that they will be outcompeted by responses to structures containing the epitopes of X5, m44, m46, and other antibodies that bind germline BCRs with much higher affinity/avidity. This hypothesis, if further supported by data, could contribute to our understanding of how HIV-1 evades immune responses and offer new concepts for design of effective vaccine immunogens.},

Reprogramming their cleavage specificities allows the targeting of specific biological sites for gene correction or conversion. We used computational protein design to alter the cleavage specificity of I-MsoI for three contiguous base pair substitutions, resulting in an endonuclease whose activity and specificity for its new site rival that of wild-type I-MsoI for the original site. Concerted design for all simultaneous substitutions was more successful than a modular approach against individual substitutions, highlighting the importance of context-dependent redesign and optimization of protein-DNA interactions. We then used computational design based on the crystal structure of the designed complex, which revealed significant unanticipated shifts in DNA conformation, to create an endonuclease that specifically cleaves a site with four contiguous base pair substitutions. Our results demonstrate that specificity switches for multiple concerted base pair substitutions can be computationally designed, and that iteration between design and structure determination provides a route to large scale reprogramming of specificity.},

abstract = {During HIV-1 infection, antibodies are generated against the region of the viral gp120 envelope glycoprotein that binds CD4, the primary receptor for HIV-1. Among these antibodies, VRC01 achieves broad neutralization of diverse viral strains. We determined the crystal structure of VRC01 in complex with a human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 gp120 core. VRC01 partially mimics CD4 interaction with gp120. A shift from the CD4-defined orientation, however, focuses VRC01 onto the vulnerable site of initial CD4 attachment, allowing it to overcome the glycan and conformational masking that diminishes the neutralization potency of most CD4-binding-site antibodies. To achieve this recognition, VRC01 contacts gp120 mainly through immunoglobulin V-gene regions substantially altered from their genomic precursors. Partial receptor mimicry and extensive affinity maturation thus facilitate neutralization of HIV-1 by natural human antibodies.},

We used knowledge of HIV-1 envelope structure to develop antigenically resurfaced glycoproteins specific for the structurally conserved site of initial CD4 receptor binding. These probes were used to identify sera with NAbs to the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) and to isolate individual B cells from such an HIV-1-infected donor. By expressing immunoglobulin genes from individual cells, we identified three monoclonal antibodies, including a pair of somatic variants that neutralized over 90% of circulating HIV-1 isolates. Exceptionally broad HIV-1 neutralization can be achieved with individual antibodies targeted to the functionally conserved CD4bs of glycoprotein 120, an important insight for future HIV-1 vaccine design.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that broadly neutralizing antibodies (NAb) are more frequent in long-term non-progressors (LTNP) than in other HIV-1 infected patients, but nothing is known about the envelope regions targeted by these broadly NAb. We investigated whether the breadth of neutralizing activity of sera was associated with the presence of specific antibodies (2F5- and/or 4E10-like, b12-like or 2G12-like antibodies) directed against conserved epitopes known to be involved in broad neutralization. METHODS: We assessed the ability of sera from 67 LTNP of the French ANRS cohort (ANRS CO15) to neutralize four heterologous primary isolates of four various clades. Competitive and non-competitive ELISA were developed for the specific comparison of levels of antibodies against these specific epitopes in neutralizing and non-neutralizing sera from LTNP. RESULTS: We found that higher 2G12-like antibody levels were significantly associated with the broadest neutralizing activity in sera from LTNP. Levels of 2G12-like antibodies were higher in the sera that neutralized the four isolates than in the others, with a median of 5.7 microg/ml [interquartile range (IQR), 2.7-9.3 microg/ml] versus 2.3 microg/ml (IQR, 1.1-3.9 microg/ml) (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.03). Levels of antibodies against the other targeted envelope epitopes did not differ significantly between broadly and non-broadly neutralizing sera. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the antigenicity of the "silent face" of gp120 that exposes the 2G12 epitope should be analysed in more detail, to find ways to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies.},

abstract = {Interactions in protein networks may place constraints on protein interface sequences to maintain correct and avoid unwanted interactions. Here we describe a "multi-constraint" protein design protocol to predict sequences optimized for multiple criteria, such as maintaining sets of interactions, and apply it to characterize the mechanism and extent to which 20 multi-specific proteins are constrained by binding to multiple partners. We find that multi-specific binding is accommodated by at least two distinct patterns. In the simplest case, all partners share key interactions, and sequences optimized for binding to either single or multiple partners recover only a subset of native amino acid residues as optimal. More interestingly, for signaling interfaces functioning as network "hubs," we identify a different, "multi-faceted" mode, where each binding partner prefers its own subset of wild-type residues within the promiscuous binding site. Here, integration of preferences across all partners results in sequences much more "native-like" than seen in optimization for any single binding partner alone, suggesting these interfaces are substantially optimized for multi-specificity. The two strategies make distinct predictions for interface evolution and design. Shared interfaces may be better small molecule targets, whereas multi-faceted interactions may be more "designable" for altered specificity patterns. The computational methodology presented here is generalizable for examining how naturally occurring protein sequences have been selected to satisfy a variety of positive and negative constraints, as well as for rationally designing proteins to have desired patterns of altered specificity.},

One reason for design failures is conformational plasticity, as proteins frequently change their conformation in response to mutations. To advance protein design, here we describe a method employing flexible backbone ensembles to predict sequences tolerated for a protein-protein interface. We show that the predictions are enriched in functional proteins when compared to a phage display screen quantitatively mapping the energy landscape for the interaction between human growth hormone and its receptor. Our model for structural plasticity is inspired by coupled side chain-backbone "backrub" motions observed in high-resolution protein crystal structures. Although the modeled structural changes are subtle, our results on predicting sequence plasticity suggest that backrub sampling may capture a sizable fraction of localized conformational changes that occur in proteins. The described method has implications for predicting sequence libraries to enable challenging protein engineering problems.},

abstract = {Individuals infected with HIV-1 and nearly everyone vaccinated with HIV-1 vaccines will, in time, generate antibodies against viral proteins. These antibodies do not resolve natural infection, and vaccine candidates that successfully stimulate the production of high titers of neutralizing antibodies have failed to protect against infection. In spite of this, antibodies continue to be a focus of vaccine research. One reason for the continued interest in antibodies is the failure of a vaccine engineered to generate cell-mediated immunity against HIV. Successful protective immunity against most intracellular pathogens involves several arms of the immune response. A successful vaccine should also stimulate both protective cell-mediated immunity and specific antibody. Efforts should be directed toward making a vaccine that will stimulate the production of 1) more antibody, 2) more broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibody (broadly neutralizing antibodies), and 3) antibody with a particular functional activity (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; catalytic antibodies).},

This has resulted in 107 different primers in only 18 multiplex PCR tubes: three VH-JH, two DH-JH, two Ig kappa (IGK), one Ig lambda (IGL), three TCR beta (TCRB), two TCR gamma (TCRG), one TCR delta (TCRD), three BCL1-Ig heavy chain (IGH), and one BCL2-IGH. The PCR products of Ig/TCR genes can be analyzed for clonality assessment by heteroduplex analysis or GeneScanning. The detection rate of clonal rearrangements using the BIOMED-2 primer sets is unprecedentedly high. This is mainly based on the complementarity of the various BIOMED-2 tubes. In particular, combined application of IGH (VH-JH and DH-JH) and IGK tubes can detect virtually all clonal B-cell proliferations, even in B-cell malignancies with high levels of somatic mutations. The contribution of IGL gene rearrangements seems limited. Combined usage of the TCRB and TCRG tubes detects virtually all clonal T-cell populations, whereas the TCRD tube has added value in case of TCRgammadelta(+) T-cell proliferations. The BIOMED-2 multiplex tubes can now be used for diagnostic clonality studies as well as for the identification of PCR targets suitable for the detection of minimal residual disease.},

abstract = {The recurrence of influenza virus infection in man is attributed primarily to changes occurring in the antigenic structure of the viral surface glycoproteins, especially of the haemagglutinin (HA) molecule. Comparative antigenic analysis of epidemic influenza virus strains has allowed the description of 'strain-specific' and 'cross-reactive' antigenic determinants. However, the interpretation of these findings remained ambiguous, because the specificity of the applied antisera was insufficiently defined and because the antigenic differences among the HA molecules of various epidemic virus strains resulted presumably from a large number of amino acid substitutions. Thus, in characterizing the antigenic structure of the HA molecule, our approach has been (1) to generate a panel of monoclonal anti-HA hybridoma antibodies, (2) to use some of these antibodies to select mutants of the influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8) virus expressing antigenically altered HA molecules, and (3) to construct an operational antigenic map of the HA molecule by comparative antigenic analysis of the mutant viruses with the monoclonal antibodies. As we report here, analysis of the 34 mutant viruses selected has enabled us to define four antigenic sites on the HA molecule. Our observation that these sites have undergone antigenic drift to a different extent in nature implies that the mechanisms responsible for antigenic drift act selectively on distinct structures of the HA molecule.},

abstract = {A Gaussian solvent-exclusion model for the solvation free energy is developed. It is based on theoretical considerations and parametrized with experimental data. When combined with the CHARMM 19 polar hydrogen energy function, it provides an effective energy function (EEF1) for proteins in solution. The solvation model assumes that the solvation free energy of a protein molecule is a sum of group contributions, which are determined from values for small model compounds. For charged groups, the self-energy contribution is accounted for primarily by the exclusion model. Ionic side-chains are neutralized, and a distance-dependent dielectric constant is used to approximate the charge-charge interactions in solution. The resulting EEF1 is subjected to a number of tests. Molecular dynamics simulations at room temperature of several proteins in their native conformation are performed, and stable trajectories are obtained. The deviations from the experimental structures are similar to those observed in explicit water simulations. The calculated enthalpy of unfolding of a polyalanine helix is found to be in good agreement with experimental data. Results reported elsewhere show that EEF1 clearly distinguishes correctly from incorrectly folded proteins, both in static energy evaluations and in molecular dynamics simulations and that unfolding pathways obtained by high-temperature molecular dynamics simulations agree with those obtained by explicit water simulations. Thus, this energy function appears to provide a realistic first approximation to the effective energy hypersurface of proteins.},

Here, we present a cryoEM study of a tubular assembly of CA and a high-resolution NMR structure of the CA C-terminal domain (CTD) dimer. In the solution dimer structure, the monomers exhibit different relative orientations compared to previous X-ray structures. The solution structure fits well into the EM density map, suggesting that the dimer interface is retained in the assembled CA. We also identified a CTD-CTD interface at the local three-fold axis in the cryoEM map and confirmed its functional importance by mutagenesis. In the tubular assembly, CA intermolecular interfaces vary slightly, accommodating the asymmetry present in tubes. This provides the necessary plasticity to allow for controlled virus capsid dis/assembly.},

abstract = {Broadly cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies define epitopes for vaccine development against HIV and other highly mutable viruses. Crystal structures are available for several such antibody-epitope complexes, but methods are needed to translate that structural information into immunogens that re-elicit similar antibodies. We describe a general computational method to design epitope-scaffolds in which contiguous structural epitopes are transplanted to scaffold proteins for conformational stabilization and immune presentation. Epitope-scaffolds designed for the poorly immunogenic but conserved HIV epitope 4E10 exhibited high epitope structural mimicry, bound with higher affinities to monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4E10 than the cognate peptide, and inhibited HIV neutralization by HIV+ sera. Rabbit immunization with an epitope-scaffold induced antibodies with structural specificity highly similar to mAb 4E10, an important advance toward elicitation of neutralizing activity. The results demonstrate that computationally designed epitope-scaffolds are valuable as structure-specific serological reagents and as immunogens to elicit antibodies with predetermined structural specificity.},

Various strategies have been used to create soluble trimers of the envelope to mimic the structure of the native viral protein, including mutation of the gp120-gp41 cleavage site, introduction of disulfide bonds, and fusion to heterologous trimerization motifs. We compared the effects on quaternary structure, antigenicity, and immunogenicity of three such motifs: T4 fibritin, a GCN4 variant, and the Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase catalytic subunit. Fusion of each motif to the C-terminus of a noncleavable JRCSF gp140(-) envelope protein led to enhanced trimerization but had limited effects on the antigenic profile and CD4-binding ability of the trimers. Immunization of rabbits provided no evidence that the trimerized gp140(-) constructs induced significantly improved neutralizing antibodies to several HIV-1 pseudoviruses, compared to gp140 lacking a trimerization motif. However, modest differences in both binding specificity and neutralizing antibody responses were observed among the various immunogens.},

abstract = {During immune responses, antibodies are selected for their ability to bind to foreign antigens with high affinity, in part by their ability to undergo homotypic bivalent binding. However, this type of binding is not always possible. For example, the small number of gp140 glycoprotein spikes displayed on the surface of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disfavours homotypic bivalent antibody binding. Here we show that during the human antibody response to HIV, somatic mutations that increase antibody affinity also increase breadth and neutralizing potency. Surprisingly, the responding naive and memory B cells produce polyreactive antibodies, which are capable of bivalent heteroligation between one high-affinity anti-HIV-gp140 combining site and a second low-affinity site on another molecular structure on HIV. Although cross-reactivity to self-antigens or polyreactivity is strongly selected against during B-cell development, it is a common serologic feature of certain infections in humans, including HIV, Epstein-Barr virus and hepatitis C virus. Seventy-five per cent of the 134 monoclonal anti-HIV-gp140 antibodies cloned from six patients with high titres of neutralizing antibodies are polyreactive. Despite the low affinity of the polyreactive combining site, heteroligation demonstrably increases the apparent affinity of polyreactive antibodies to HIV.},

In order to permit the efficient identification of vaccines with enhanced capacity for eliciting cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and to assess the overall breadth and potency of vaccine-elicited NAb reactivity, we assembled a panel of 109 molecularly cloned HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses representing a broad range of genetic and geographic diversity. Viral isolates from all major circulating genetic subtypes were included, as were viruses derived shortly after transmission and during the early and chronic stages of infection. We assembled a panel of genetically diverse HIV-1-positive (HIV-1(+)) plasma pools to assess the neutralization sensitivities of the entire virus panel. When the viruses were rank ordered according to the average sensitivity to neutralization by the HIV-1(+) plasmas, a continuum of average sensitivity was observed. Clustering analysis of the patterns of sensitivity defined four subgroups of viruses: those having very high (tier 1A), above-average (tier 1B), moderate (tier 2), or low (tier 3) sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization. We also investigated potential associations between characteristics of the viral isolates (clade, stage of infection, and source of virus) and sensitivity to NAb. In particular, higher levels of NAb activity were observed when the virus and plasma pool were matched in clade. These data provide the first systematic assessment of the overall neutralization sensitivities of a genetically and geographically diverse panel of circulating HIV-1 strains. These reference viruses can facilitate the systematic characterization of NAb responses elicited by candidate vaccine immunogens.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Novel strategies are needed for the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to the HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp120. Experimental evidence suggests that combinations of antibodies that are broadly neutralizing in vitro may protect against challenge with HIV in nonhuman primates, and a small number of these antibodies have been selected by repertoire sampling of B cells and by the fractionation of antiserum from some patients with prolonged disease. Yet no additional strategies for identifying conserved epitopes, eliciting antibodies to these epitopes, and determining whether these epitopes are accessible to antibodies have been successful to date. The defining of additional conserved, accessible epitopes against which one can elicit antibodies will increase the probability that some may be the targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We postulate that additional cryptic epitopes of gp120 are present, against which neutralizing antibodies might be elicited even though these antibodies are not elicited by gp120, and that many of these epitopes may be accessible to antibodies should they be formed. We demonstrate a strategy for eliciting antibodies in mice against selected cryptic, conformationally dependent conserved epitopes of gp120 by immunizing with multiple identical copies of covalently linked peptides (MCPs). This has been achieved with MCPs representing 3 different domains of gp120. We show that some cryptic epitopes on gp120 are accessible to the elicited antibodies, and some epitopes in the CD4 binding region are not accessible. The antibodies bind to gp120 with relatively high affinity, and bind to oligomeric gp120 on the surface of infected cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Immunization with MCPs comprised of selected peptides of HIV gp120 is able to elicit antibodies against conserved, conformationally dependent epitopes of gp120 that are not immunogenic when presented as gp120. Some of these cryptic epitopes are accessible to the elicited antibodies.},

abstract = {There is an intense interplay between HIV and the immune system, and the literature is replete with studies describing various immunological phenomena associated with HIV infection. Many of these phenomena seem too broad in scope to be attributable either to HIV-infected cells or to the HIV-specific immune response. Recently, a more fundamental understanding of how HIV affects various T cells and T cell compartments has emerged. This review covers the role of immune activation in HIV immunopathogenesis, how that activation could be mediated directly by HIV replicating within and damaging the gut mucosal barrier, how HIV affects multiple T cell functions and phenotypes, and how chronic HIV replication induces immune modulatory pathways to negatively regulate certain functions in HIV-specific T cells.},

Recent data indicate that the HIV-1 quasispecies that arise following a mucosal infection are usually derived from a single transmitted virus. Moreover, the finding that the first effective immune responses drive the selection of virus escape mutations provides insight into the earliest immune responses against the transmitted virus and their contributions to the control of acute viraemia. Strong innate and adaptive immune responses occur subsequently but they are too late to eliminate the infection. In this Review, we discuss recent studies on the kinetics and quality of early immune responses to HIV-1 and their implications for developing a successful preventive HIV-1 vaccine.},

abstract = {The interaction of biologicalmacromolecules, whether protein-DNA, antibody-antigen, hormone-receptor, etc., illustrates the complexity and diversity of molecular recognition. The importance of such interactions in the immune response, signal transduction cascades, and gene expression cannot be overstated. It is of great interest to determine the nature of the forces that stabilize the interaction. The thermodynamics of association are characterized by the stoichiometry of the interaction (n), the association constant (K(a)), the free energy (DeltaG(b)), enthalpy (DeltaH(b)), entropy (DeltaS(b)), and heat capacity of binding (DeltaC(p)). In combination with structural information, the energetics of binding can provide a complete dissection of the interaction and aid in identifying the most important regions of the interface and the energetic contributions. Various indirect methods (ELISA, RIA, surface plasmon resonance, etc.) are routinely used to characterize biologically important interactions. Here we describe the use of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in the study of protein-protein interactions. ITC is the most quantitative means available for measuring the thermodynamic properties of a protein-protein interaction. ITC measures the binding equilibrium directly by determining the heat evolved on association of a ligand with its binding partner. In a single experiment, the values of the binding constant (K(a)), the stoichiometry (n), and the enthalpy of binding (DeltaH(b)) are determined. The free energy and entropy of binding are determined from the association constant. The temperature dependence of the DeltaH(b) parameter, measured by performing the titration at varying temperatures, describes the DeltaC(p) term. As a practical application of the method, we describe the use of ITC to study the interaction between cytochrome c and two monoclonal antibodies.},

abstract = {Antibodies provide effective antiviral immunity despite the fact that viruses escape into cells when they infect. Here we show that antibodies remain attached to viruses after cell infection and mediate an intracellular immune response that disables virions in the cytosol. We have discovered that cells possess a cytosolic IgG receptor, tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21), which binds to antibodies with a higher affinity than any other IgG receptor in the human body. TRIM21 rapidly recruits to incoming antibody-bound virus and targets it to the proteasome via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Proteasomal targeting leads to rapid degradation of virions in the cytosol before translation of virally encoded genes. Infection experiments demonstrate that at physiological antibody concentrations TRIM21 neutralizes viral infection. These results reveal an intracellular arm of adaptive immunity in which the protection mediated by antibodies does not end at the cell membrane but continues inside the cell to provide a last line of defense against infection.},

abstract = {CD4(+) T-helper cells that selectively produce interleukin (IL)-17 (T(H)17), are critical for host defence and autoimmunity. Although crucial for T(H)17 cells in vivo, IL-23 has been thought to be incapable of driving initial differentiation. Rather, IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\beta$1 have been proposed to be the factors responsible for initiating specification. Here we show that T(H)17 differentiation can occur in the absence of TGF-$\beta$ signalling. Neither IL-6 nor IL-23 alone efficiently generated T(H)17 cells; however, these cytokines in combination with IL-1$\beta$ effectively induced IL-17 production in naive precursors, independently of TGF-$\beta$. Epigenetic modification of the Il17a, Il17f and Rorc promoters proceeded without TGF-$\beta$1, allowing the generation of cells that co-expressed ROR$\gamma$t (encoded by Rorc) and T-bet. T-bet(+)ROR$\gamma$t(+) T(H)17 cells are generated in vivo during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and adoptively transferred T(H)17 cells generated with IL-23 without TGF-$\beta$1 were pathogenic in this disease model. These data indicate an alternative mode for T(H)17 differentiation. Consistent with genetic data linking IL23R with autoimmunity, our findings re-emphasize the importance of IL-23 and therefore may have therapeutic implications.},

abstract = {Individual variation in the Ig germline gene repertoire leads to individual differences in the combinatorial diversity of the Ab repertoire, but the study of such variation has been problematic. The application of high-throughput DNA sequencing to the study of rearranged Ig genes now makes this possible. The sequencing of thousands of VDJ rearrangements from an individual, either from genomic DNA or expressed mRNA, should allow their germline IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ repertoires to be inferred. In addition, where previously mere glimpses of diversity could be gained from sequencing studies, new large data sets should allow the rearrangement frequency of different genes and alleles to be seen with clarity. We analyzed the DNA of 108,210 human IgH chain rearrangements from 12 individuals and determined their individual IGH genotypes. The number of reportedly functional IGHV genes and allelic variants ranged from 45 to 60, principally because of variable levels of gene heterozygosity, and included 14 previously unreported IGHV polymorphisms. New polymorphisms of the IGHD3-16 and IGHJ6 genes were also seen. At heterozygous loci, remarkably different rearrangement frequencies were seen for the various IGHV alleles, and these frequencies were consistent between individuals. The specific alleles that make up an individual's Ig genotype may therefore be critical in shaping the combinatorial repertoire. The extent of genotypic variation between individuals is highlighted by an individual with aplastic anemia who appears to lack six contiguous IGHD genes on both chromosomes. These deletions significantly alter the potential expressed IGH repertoire, and possibly immune function, in this individual.},

In this work, we show that massively parallel DNA sequencing of rearranged immune receptor loci can provide direct detection and tracking of immune diversity and expanded clonal lymphocyte populations in physiological and pathological contexts. DNA was isolated from blood and tissue samples, a series of redundant primers was used to amplify diverse DNA rearrangements, and the resulting mixtures of barcoded amplicons were sequenced using long-read ultra deep sequencing. Individual DNA molecules were then characterized on the basis of DNA segments that had been joined to make a functional (or nonfunctional) immune effector. Current experimental designs can accommodate up to 150 samples in a single sequence run, with the depth of sequencing sufficient to identify stable and dynamic aspects of the immune repertoire in both normal and diseased circumstances. These data provide a high-resolution picture of immune spectra in normal individuals and in patients with hematological malignancies, illuminating, in the latter case, both the initial behavior of clonal tumor populations and the later suppression or re-emergence of such populations after treatment.},

abstract = {In CAPRI rounds 13-19, the most native-like structure predicted by RosettaDock resulted in two high, one medium, and one acceptable accuracy model out of 13 targets. The current rounds of CAPRI were especially challenging with many unbound and homology modeled starting structures. Novel docking methods, including EnsembleDock and SnugDock, allowed backbone conformational sampling during docking and enabled the creation of more accurate models. For Target 32, $\alpha$-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor-subtilisin savinase, we sampled different backbone conformations at an interfacial loop to produce five high-quality models including the most accurate structure submitted in the challenge (2.1 {\AA} ligand rmsd, 0.52 {\AA} interface rmsd). For Target 41, colicin-immunity protein, we used EnsembleDock to sample the ensemble of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) models of the immunity protein to generate a medium accuracy structure. Experimental data identifying the catalytic residues at the binding interface for Target 40 (trypsin-inhibitor) were used to filter RosettaDock global rigid body docking decoys to determine high accuracy predictions for the two distinct binding sites in which the inhibitor interacts with trypsin. We discuss our generalized approach to selecting appropriate methods for different types of docking problems. The current toolset provides some robustness to errors in homology models, but significant challenges remain in accommodating larger backbone uncertainties and in sampling adequately for global searches.},

The protocol was tested on a benchmark of 54 antibody crystal structures. The median root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the antigen binding pocket comprised of all the CDR residues was 1.5 A with 80% of the targets having an rmsd lower than 2.0 A. The median backbone heavy atom global rmsd of the CDR H3 loop prediction was 1.6, 1.9, 2.4, 3.1, and 6.0 A for very short (4-6 residues), short (7-9), medium (10-11), long (12-14) and very long (17-22) loops, respectively. When the set of ten top-scoring antibody homology models are used in local ensemble docking to antigen, a moderate-to-high accuracy docking prediction was achieved in seven of fifteen targets. This success in computational docking with high-resolution homology models is encouraging, but challenges still remain in modeling antibody structures for sequences with long H3 loops. This first large-scale antibody-antigen docking study using homology models reveals the level of "functional accuracy" of these structural models toward protein engineering applications.},

abstract = {The high-resolution prediction of protein-protein docking can now create structures with atomic-level accuracy. This progress arises from both improvements in the rapid sampling of conformations and increased accuracy of binding free energy calculations. Consequently, the quality of models submitted to the blind prediction challenge CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions) has steadily increased, including complexes predicted from homology structures of one binding partner and complexes with atomic accuracy at the interface. By exploiting experimental information, docking has created model structures for real applications, even when confronted with challenges such as moving backbones and uncertain monomer structures. Work remains to be done in docking large or flexible proteins, ranking models consistently, and producing models accurate enough to allow computational design of higher affinities or specificities.},

abstract = {CAPRI Rounds 3, 4, and 5 are the first public test of the published RosettaDock algorithm. The targets cover a wide range of sizes and shapes. For most targets, published biological information indicated the region of the binding site on at least one docking partner. The RosettaDock algorithm produced high accuracy predictions for three targets, medium-accuracy predictions for two targets, and an acceptable prediction for one target. RosettaDock predicted all five targets with less than 450 residues to high or medium accuracy, but it predicted only one of seven targets with above 450 residues to acceptable accuracy. RosettaDock's high-accuracy predictions for small to moderately large targets reveal the predictive power and fidelity of the algorithm, especially the high-resolution refinement and scoring protocol. In addition, RosettaDock can predict complexes from at least one homology-modeled docking partner with comparable accuracy to unbound cases of similar size. Larger targets present a more intensive sampling problem, and some large targets present repulsive barriers to entering the binding site. Ongoing improvements to RosettaDock's low-resolution search may alleviate this problem. This first public test suggests that RosettaDock can be useful in a significant range of applications in biochemistry and cell biology.},

abstract = {Recombinant proteins are of great commercial and scientific interest. Yet, most production methods in mammalian cells involve the time- and labor-consuming step of creating stable cell lines. Production methods based on transient gene expression are advantageous in terms of speed and versatility; yet, depending on the transfection protocol, transient transfection faces some bottlenecks such as a priori complex formation, limitations in terms of transfection and production media used and the need for medium exchange prior to and/or after transfection. Published protocols for transfection of suspension-adapted HEK-293 cells with polyethyleneimine have shown great promise in overcoming some of these bottlenecks, but still require a priori complex formation for optimal yields and limit the choice of transfection and production media. Here, we report successful in situ transfection of suspension-adapted HEK-293 cells with 25-kDa linear polyethyleneimine at densities up to 20 x 10(6) cells/mL in complex media followed by production at lower cell densities (1 x 10(6) cells/mL). After concentrating cells to such high densities, transfection of HEK-293 cells becomes possible in most commonly used media and is not restricted to a specific medium. Furthermore, there is no need to make transfection complexes a priori, a step that prevents inline sterile filtration of the DNA bulk for transfection, an important consideration when scaling processes up to 100 or 1,000 L. Finally, transfecting HEK-293 cells at high density in complex media is superior to existing transfection protocols and doubles yields of recombinant protein obtainable by transient gene expression.},

Of 50 sera, 49 neutralized at least 1 of the prototype strains; however, none displayed neutralizing activity against primary isolates of HIV-1.

abstract = {The human bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) are non-Class A members of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, with very limited structural information. Amino acid sequence analysis reveals that most of the important motifs present in the transmembrane helices (TM1-TM7) of the well studied Class A GPCRs are absent in T2Rs, raising fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms of activation and how T2Rs recognize bitter ligands with diverse chemical structures. In this study, the bitter receptor T2R1 was used to systematically investigate the role of 15 transmembrane amino acids in T2Rs, including 13 highly conserved residues, by amino acid replacements guided by molecular modeling. Functional analysis of the mutants by calcium imaging analysis revealed that replacement of Asn-66(2.65) and the highly conserved Asn-24(1.50) resulted in greater than 90% loss of agonist-induced signaling. Our results show that Asn-24(1.50) plays a crucial role in receptor activation by mediating an hydrogen bond network connecting TM1-TM2-TM7, whereas Asn-66(2.65) is essential for binding to the agonist dextromethorphan. The interhelical hydrogen bond between Asn-24(1.50) and Arg-55(2.54) restrains T2R receptor activity because loss of this bond in I27A and R55A mutants results in hyperactive receptor. The conserved amino acids Leu-197(5.50), Ser-200(5.53), and Leu-201(5.54) form a putative LXXSL motif which performs predominantly a structural role by stabilizing the helical conformation of TM5 at the cytoplasmic end. This study provides for the first time mechanistic insights into the roles of the conserved transmembrane residues in T2Rs and allows comparison of the activation mechanisms of T2Rs with the Class A GPCRs.},

Homology 3-D models of p$\beta$(2)AR can be useful in predicting similarities and differences, which might in turn increase the comparative understanding of ligand interactions with the h$\beta$(2)AR. In this work, the p$\beta$(2)AR amino acid sequence was used to carry out homology modeling. The selected p$\beta$(2)AR 3-D structure was structurally and energetically optimized and used as a model for further theoretical study. The homology model of p$\beta$(2)AR has a 3-D structure very similar to the crystal structures of recently studied h$\beta$(2)AR. This was also corroborated by sequence identity, RMSD, Ramachandran map, TM-score and docking results. Upon performing molecular docking simulations with the AutoDock4.0.1 program on p$\beta$(2)AR, it was found that a set of well-known $\beta$(2)AR ligands reach two distinct binding sites on p$\beta$(2)AR. Whereas one of these sites is similar to that reported on the h$\beta$(2)AR crystal structure, the other can explain some important experimental observations. Additionally, the theoretical affinity estimated for ICI118,551 closely agrees with affinities estimated from experimental in vitro data. The experimental differences between the human/porcine $\beta$(2)ARs in relation to ligand affinity can in part be elucidated by observations in this molecular modeling study.},

We have examined V(D)J recombination as a function of joining signal sequence. Plasmid substrates with mutations in one or both of the heptamer-spacer-nonamer sequences were tested for recombination in a pre-B-cell line active in V(D)J recombination. No signal variant recombines more efficiently than the consensus forms of the joining signals. We find the heptamer sequence to be the most important; specifically, the three bases closest to the recombination crossover site are critical. The nonamer is not as rigidly defined, and it is not important to maintain the five consecutive As that distinguish the consensus nonamer sequence. Both types of signals display very similar sequence requirements and have in common an intolerance for changes in spacer length greater than 1 bp. Although the two signal types share sequence motifs, we find no evidence of a role in recombination for homology between the signals, suggesting that they serve primarily as protein recognition and binding sites.},

abstract = {HIV-1 resists neutralization by most antibodies. Two somatically related human antibodies, PG9 and PG16, however, each neutralize 70 to 80% of circulating HIV-1 isolates. Here we present the structure of the antigen-binding fragment of PG16 in monoclinic and orthorhombic lattices at 2.4 and 4.0 A, respectively, and use a combination of structural analysis, paratope dissection, and neutralization assessment to determine the functional relevance of three unusual PG9/PG16 features: N-linked glycosylation, extensive affinity maturation, and a heavy chain-third complementarity-determining region (CDR H3) that is one of the longest observed in human antibodies. Glycosylation extended off the side of the light chain variable domain and was not required for neutralization. The CDR H3 formed an axe-shaped subdomain, which comprised 42% of the CDR surface, with the axe head looming approximately 20 A above the other combining loops. Comprehensive sets of chimeric swaps between PG9 and PG16 of light chain, heavy chain, and CDR H3 were employed to decipher structure-function relationships. Chimeric swaps generally complemented functionally, with differences in PG9/PG16 neutralization related primarily to residue differences in CDR H3. Meanwhile, chimeric reversions to genomic V genes showed isolate-dependent effects, with affinity maturation playing a significant role in augmenting neutralization breadth (P = 0.036) and potency (P < 0.0001). The structural and functional details of extraordinary CDR H3 and extensive affinity maturation provide insights into the neutralization mechanism of and the elicitation pathway for broadly neutralizing antibodies like PG9 and PG16.},

abstract = {Seven diverse primary isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were examined and found to be refractory to neutralization by antisera to recombinant gp120 (rgp120) protein from HIV-1 MN. This stands in marked contrast to the sensitivity exhibited by certain laboratory-adapted viruses. To understand the difference between primary and laboratory-adapted viruses, we adapted the primary virus ACH 168.10 to growth in the FDA/H9 cell line. ACH 168.10 was chosen because the V3 region of gp120 closely matches that of MN. After 4 weeks, infection became evident. The virus (168A) replicated in FDA/H9 cells with extensive cytopathic effect but was unchanged in sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization. Thus, growth in cell lines is not sufficient to render primary virus sensitive to neutralization. The 168A virus was, however, partially sensitive to CD4 immunoadhesin (CD4-Ig). Adaptation was continued to produce a persistently infected FDA/H9 culture that displayed minimal cytopathic effect. The virus (168C) was now sensitive to neutralization by MN rgp120 vaccine sera and by MN-specific monoclonal antibodies and showed increased sensitivity to HIVIG and CD4-Ig. 168C encoded three amino acid changes in gp120, including one within the V3 loop (I-166-->R, I-282-->N, G-318-->R). MN-specific monoclonal antibodies bound equally to the surface of cells infected with either neutralization-resistant or -sensitive virus. The coincidence of changes in neutralization sensitivity with changes in cell tropism and cytopathic effect suggests a common underlying mechanism(s) acting through the whole of the envelope protein complex.},

abstract = {Seven-helix transmembrane proteins, including the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), mediate a broad range of fundamental cellular activities through binding to a wide range of ligands. Understanding the structural basis for the ligand-binding selectivity of these proteins is of significance to their structure-based drug design. Comparison analysis of proteins' ligand-binding sites provides a useful way to study their structure-activity relationships. Various computational methods have been developed for the binding-site comparison of soluble proteins. In this work, we applied this approach to the analysis of the primary ligand-binding sites of 92 seven-helix transmembrane proteins. Results of the studies confirmed that the binding site of bacterial rhodopsins is indeed different from all GPCRs. In the latter group, further comparison of the binding sites indicated a group of residues that could be responsible for ligand-binding selectivity and important for structure-based drug design. Furthermore, unexpected binding-site dissimilarities were observed among adrenergic and adenosine receptors, suggesting that the percentage of the overall sequence identity between a target protein and a template protein alone is not sufficient for selecting the best template for homology modeling of seven-helix membrane proteins. These results provided novel insight into the structural basis of ligand-binding selectivity of seven-helix membrane proteins and are of practical use to the computational modeling of these proteins.},

abstract = {TREK-1, a mechanosensitive K channel from the two-pore family (K(2)P), is involved in protective regulation of the resting potential in CNS neurons and other tissues. The structure of TREK-1 and the basis of its sensitivity to stretch and variety of lipid-soluble factors remain unknown. Using existing K channel structures as modeling templates, TREK-1 was envisioned as a two-fold symmetrical complex with the gate formed primarily by the centrally positioned TM2b helices of the second homologous repeat. Opening was modeled as a conical expansion of the barrel separating TM2b's accompanied by extension of TM2a helices with the cytoplasmic TM2a-TM1b connector. Seeking first experimental support to the models we have accomplished thermodynamic analysis of mouse TREK-1 gating and functional testing of several deletion mutants. The predicted increase of the channel in-plane area ($\Delta$A) of ~5 nm(2) in models was supported by the experimental $\Delta$A of ~4 nm(2) derived from the slope of open probability versus membrane tension in HEK-293T cells and their cytoskeleton-depleted blebs. In response to steps of suction, wild-type channel produced transient currents in cell-attached patches and mostly sustained currents upon patch excision. TREK-1 motifs not present in canonical K channels include divergent cytoplasmic N- and C-termini, and a characteristic 50-residue extracellular loop in the first homologous repeat. Deletion of the extracellular loop ($\Delta$76-124) reduced the average current density in patches, increased spontaneous activity and generated a larger sub-population of high-conductance channels, while activation by tension augmented by arachidonic acid was fully retained. Further deletion of the C-terminal end ($\Delta$76-124/$\Delta$334-411) removed voltage dependency but otherwise produced no additional effect. In an attempt to generate a cysteine-free version of the channel, we mutated two remaining cysteines 159 and 219 in the transmembrane region. C219A did not compromise channel activity, whereas the C159A/S mutants were essentially inactive. Treatment with $\beta$-mercaptoethanol suggested that none of these cysteines form functionally-important disulfides.},

abstract = {Recently, several broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs) directed to the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) of gp120 have been isolated from HIV-1-positive donors. These include VRC01, 3BNC117, and NIH45-46, all of which are capable of neutralizing about 90% of circulating HIV-1 isolates and all of which induce conformational changes in the HIV-1 gp120 monomer similar to those induced by the CD4 receptor. In this study, we characterize PGV04 (also known as VRC-PG04), a MAb with potency and breadth that rivals those of the prototypic VRC01 and 3BNC117. When screened on a large panel of viruses, the neutralizing profile of PGV04 was distinct from those of CD4, b12, and VRC01. Furthermore, the ability of PGV04 to neutralize pseudovirus containing single alanine substitutions exhibited a pattern distinct from those of the other CD4bs MAbs. In particular, substitutions D279A, I420A, and I423A were found to abrogate PGV04 neutralization. In contrast to VRC01, PGV04 did not enhance the binding of 17b or X5 to their epitopes (the CD4-induced [CD4i] site) in the coreceptor region on the gp120 monomer. Furthermore, in contrast to CD4, none of the anti-CD4bs MAbs induced the expression of the 17b epitope on cell surface-expressed cleaved Env trimers. We conclude that potent CD4bs bnMAbs can display differences in the way they recognize and access the CD4bs and that mimicry of CD4, as assessed by inducing conformational changes in monomeric gp120 that lead to enhanced exposure of the CD4i site, is not uniquely correlated with effective neutralization at the site of CD4 binding on HIV-1.},

We tested the technique by calculating pK(a) values for 264 residues from 34 proteins. The standard Rosetta score function, which is independent of any environmental conditions, failed to capture pK(a) shifts. After incorporating a Coulomb electrostatic potential and optimizing the solvation reference energies for pK(a) calculations, we employed a method that allowed side-chain flexibility and achieved a root mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.83 from experimental values (0.68 after discounting 11 predictions with an error over 2 pH units). Additional degrees of side-chain conformational freedom for the proximal residues facilitated the capture of charge-charge interactions in a few cases, resulting in an overall RMSD of 0.85 pH units. The addition of backbone flexibility increased the overall RMSD to 0.93 pH units but improved relative pK(a) predictions for proximal catalytic residues. The method also captures large pK(a) shifts of lysine and some glutamate point mutations in staphylococcal nuclease. Thus, a simple and fast method based on the Rosetta score function and limited conformational sampling produces pK(a) values that will be useful when rapid estimation is essential, such as in docking, design, and folding.},

abstract = {Multiple interactions exist between human follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and the N-terminal hormone-binding fragment of the human FSH receptor (FSHR) extracellular domain (ECD). Binding of the other human glycoprotein hormones to their cognate human receptors (luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR)) was expected to be similar. This study focuses on amino acid residues in $\beta$-strands 2 (Lys(74)), 4 (Tyr(124), Asn(129), and Thr(130)), and 5 (Asp(150) and Asp(153)) of the FSHR ECD identified in the human FSH·FSHR ECD crystal structure as contact sites with the common glycoprotein hormone $\alpha$-subunit, and on noncontact residues in $\beta$-strands 2 (Ser(78)) and 8 (Asp(224) and Ser(226)) as controls. These nine residues are either invariant or highly conserved in LHR and TSHR. Mutagenesis and functional characterization of these residues in all three human receptors allowed an assessment of their contribution to binding and receptor activation. Surprisingly, the six reported $\alpha$-subunit contact residues of the FSHR ECD could be replaced without significant loss of FSH binding, while cAMP signaling potency was diminished significantly with several replacements. Comparative studies of the homologous residues in LHR and TSHR revealed both similarities and differences. The results for FSH/FSHR were analyzed on the basis of the crystal structure of the FSH·FSHR ECD complex, and comparative modeling was used to generate structures for domains, proteins, and complexes for which no structures were available. Although structural information of hormone-receptor interaction allowed the identification of hormone-receptor contact sites, functional analysis of each contact site was necessary to assess its contribution to hormone binding and receptor activation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS:Resistance of Helicobacter pylori to the standard therapeutic antimicrobial agents has been demonstrated. Although quinolones are an alternative candidate for third-line eradication therapy, quinolone resistance of H. pylori is also increasing. Quinolone resistance of H. pylori is caused by a point mutation of the DNA gyrase subunit A (GyrA) protein, especially on amino acids 87 and 91. The aim of this study is to surmise the structure of H. pylori GryA.

METHODS:The modeling of the 3-D structure of H. pylori GyrA was performed by an automated homology modeling program: SWISS-MODEL. The position of amino acids 87 and 91 in H. pylori GyrA was plotted on the homology model. To estimate the function of quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR), the structure of H. pylori GyrA was compared with Escherichia coli GyrA.

RESULTS:A molecular model of H. pylori GyrA could be predicted using SWISS-MODEL. The GyrA N- and C-terminal domains closely resembled those of E. coli. The position of amino acids 87 and 91 in H. pylori GyrA was part of the DNA binding region (head dimer interface) on the GyrA N-terminal domain.

CONCLUSION:Our homology model of H. pylori GryA suggests that the quinolone resistance-determining region is on the head dimer interface of the GyrA N-terminal domain.},

abstract = {HIV-1 variants transmitted to infants are often resistant to maternal neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), suggesting that they have escaped maternal NAb pressure. To define the molecular basis of NAb escape that contributes to selection of transmitted variants, we analyzed 5 viruses from 2 mother-to-child transmission pairs, in which the infant virus, but not the maternal virus, was resistant to neutralization by maternal plasma near transmission. We generated chimeric viruses between maternal and infant envelope clones obtained near transmission and examined neutralization by maternal plasma. The molecular determinants of NAb escape were distinct, even when comparing two maternal variants to the transmitted infant virus within one pair, in which insertions in V4 of gp120 and substitutions in HR2 of gp41 conferred neutralization resistance. In another pair, deletions and substitutions in V1 to V3 conferred resistance, but neither V1/V2 nor V3 alone was sufficient. Although the sequence determinants of escape were distinct, all of them involved modifications of potential N-linked glycosylation sites. None of the regions that mediated escape were major linear targets of maternal NAbs because corresponding peptides failed to compete for neutralization. Instead, these regions disrupted multiple distal epitopes targeted by HIV-1-specific monoclonal antibodies, suggesting that escape from maternal NAbs occurred through conformational masking of distal epitopes. This strategy likely allows HIV-1 to utilize relatively limited changes in the envelope to preserve the ability to infect a new host while simultaneously evading multiple NAb specificities present in maternal plasma.},

These epitopes can be engrafted onto protein scaffolds to serve as immunogens with high structural fidelity. Although antibodies that bind to this core GP41 epitope can be elicited, they lack neutralizing activity. To understand this paradox, we used biophysical methods to investigate the binding of human 2F5 to the MPER in a membrane environment, where it resides in vivo. Recognition is stepwise, through a paratope more extensive than core binding site contacts alone, and dynamic rearrangement through an apparent scoop-like movement of heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) is essential for MPER extraction from the viral membrane. Core-epitope recognition on the virus requires the induction of conformational changes in both the MPER and the paratope. Hence, target neutralization through this lipid-embedded viral segment places stringent requirements on the plasticity of the antibody combining site.},

abstract = {A vaccine capable of stimulating protective antiviral antibody responses is needed to curtail the global AIDS epidemic caused by HIV-1. Although rarely elicited during the course of natural infection or upon conventional vaccination, the membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER) of the HIV-1 glycoprotein of M(r) 41,000 (gp41) envelope protein subunit is the target of 3 such human broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs): 4E10, 2F5, and Z13e1. How these BNAbs bind to their lipid-embedded epitopes and mediate antiviral activity is unclear, but such information might offer important insight into a worldwide health imperative. Here, EPR and NMR techniques were used to define the manner in which these BNAbs differentially recognize viral membrane-encrypted residues configured within the L-shaped helix-hinge-helix MPER segment. Two distinct modes of antibody-mediated interference of viral infection were identified. 2F5, like 4E10, induces large conformational changes in the MPER relative to the membrane. However, although 4E10 straddles the hinge and extracts residues W672 and F673, 2F5 lifts up residues N-terminal to the hinge region, exposing L669 and W670. In contrast, Z13e1 effects little change in membrane orientation or conformation, but rather immobilizes the MPER hinge through extensive rigidifying surface contacts. Thus, BNAbs disrupt HIV-1 MPER fusogenic functions critical for virus entry into human CD4 T cells and macrophages either by preventing hinge motion or by perturbing MPER orientation. HIV-1 MPER features important for targeted vaccine design have been revealed, the implications of which extend to BNAb targets on other viral fusion proteins.},

abstract = {The serotonin transporter (SERT) regulates extracellular levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the brain by facilitating uptake of released 5-hydroxytryptamine into neuronal cells. SERT is the target for widely used antidepressant drugs, including imipramine, fluoxetine, and (S)-citalopram, which are competitive inhibitors of the transport function. Knowledge of the molecular details of the antidepressant binding sites in SERT has been limited due to lack of structural data on SERT. Here, we present a characterization of the (S)-citalopram binding pocket in human SERT (hSERT) using mutational and computational approaches. Comparative modeling and ligand docking reveal that (S)-citalopram fits into the hSERT substrate binding pocket, where (S)-citalopram can adopt a number of different binding orientations. We find, however, that only one of these binding modes is functionally relevant from studying the effects of 64 point mutations around the putative substrate binding site. The mutational mapping also identify novel hSERT residues that are crucial for (S)-citalopram binding. The model defines the molecular determinants for (S)-citalopram binding to hSERT and demonstrates that the antidepressant binding site overlaps with the substrate binding site.},

abstract = {Development of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 will likely require elicitation of broad and potent neutralizing antibodies against the trimeric surface envelope glycoprotein (Env). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) PG9 and PG16 neutralize approximately 80% of HIV-1 isolates across all clades with extraordinary potency and target novel epitopes preferentially expressed on Env trimers. As these neutralization properties are ideal for a vaccine-elicited antibody response to HIV-1, their structural basis was investigated. The crystal structure of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of PG16 at 2.5 A resolution revealed its unusually long, 28-residue, complementarity determining region (CDR) H3 forms a unique, stable subdomain that towers above the antibody surface. A 7-residue "specificity loop" on the "hammerhead" subdomain was identified that, when transplanted from PG16 to PG9 and vice versa, accounted for differences in the fine specificity and neutralization of these two mAbs. The PG16 electron density maps also revealed that a CDR H3 tyrosine was sulfated, which was confirmed for both PG9 (doubly) and PG16 (singly) by mass spectral analysis. We further showed that tyrosine sulfation plays a role in binding and neutralization. An N-linked glycan modification is observed in the variable light chain, but not required for antigen recognition. Further, the crystal structure of the PG9 light chain at 3.0 A facilitated homology modeling to support the presence of these unusual features in PG9. Thus, PG9 and PG16 use unique structural features to mediate potent neutralization of HIV-1 that may be of utility in antibody engineering and for high-affinity recognition of a variety of therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Signaling pathways depend on regulatory protein-protein interactions; controlling these interactions in cells has important applications for reengineering biological functions. As many regulatory proteins are modular, considerable progress in engineering signaling circuits has been made by recombining commonly occurring domains. Our ability to predictably engineer cellular functions, however, is constrained by complex crosstalk observed in naturally occurring domains. Here we demonstrate a strategy for improving and simplifying protein network engineering: using computational design to create orthogonal (non-crossreacting) protein-protein interfaces. We validated the design of the interface between a key signaling protein, the GTPase Cdc42, and its activator, Intersectin, biochemically and by solving the crystal structure of the engineered complex. The designed GTPase (orthoCdc42) is activated exclusively by its engineered cognate partner (orthoIntersectin), but maintains the ability to interface with other GTPase signaling circuit components in vitro. In mammalian cells, orthoCdc42 activity can be regulated by orthoIntersectin, but not wild-type Intersectin, showing that the designed interaction can trigger complex processes. Computational design of protein interfaces thus promises to provide specific components that facilitate the predictable engineering of cellular functions.},

A subsequent induced-fit isomerization led to high-affinity complexes with a deep and narrow binding site. A protein antigen identified by repertoire selection made use of an unrelated antibody isomer with a wide, shallow binding site. Conformational diversity, whereby one sequence adopts multiple structures and multiple functions, can increase the effective size of the antibody repertoire but may also lead to autoimmunity and allergy.},

Here, we describe a combined computational and experimental strategy to design new phosphorylation sites into globular proteins to regulate their functions. We target a peptide recognition protein, the Erbin PDZ domain, to be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Comparing the five successful designs to the unsuccessful cases, we find a trade-off between protein stability and the ability to be modified by phosphorylation. In two designs, Erbin's peptide binding function is modified by phosphorylation, where the presence of the phosphate group destabilizes peptide binding. One of these showed an additional switch in specificity by introducing favorable interactions between a designed arginine in the peptide and phosphoserine on the PDZ domain. Because of the diversity of PDZ domains, this opens avenues for the design of related phosphoswitchable domains to create a repertoire of regulatable interaction parts for synthetic biology.},

abstract = {Diversity in antibody structure is crucial to the ability of the adaptive immune system to recognize the tremendously diverse set of potential antigens. The diversity in structure is most apparent in the six hypervariable loops of the complementarity-determining regions. However, given that these loops occur at the interface of the heavy- and light-chain variable domains and form the antigen-binding site, the relative orientation of the heavy- and light-chain variable domains can create another source of structural diversity leading to changes in antigen binding. Here, we first reexamine the diversity of V(L):V(H) orientations in existing antibody crystal structures using 153 nonredundant sequences, demonstrating that the variation in V(L):V(H) orientation is greater than that expected from effects of crystal packing, antigen binding, or the presence of antibody constant regions and increases, on average, as sequence similarity decreases for residues in the interface between the domains. We developed a tool for predicting the relative orientations of the heavy- and light-chain variable domains using side-chain rotamer sampling in the interface and molecular-mechanics-based energy calculations. When using variable domain backbones from the crystal structures, the predicted orientation is very close (<1 A RMSD) to the crystallographically observed orientation in most cases, confirming that the V(L):V(H) orientation is determined by the antibody sequence and suggesting an approach to predicting the relative orientation of the variable domains when building homology models of antibodies. When applied to antibody homology models generated from templates with 55-75% sequence identity, we predict the V(L):V(H) orientation of 20 antibodies with an average/median RMSD of 2.1/1.6 A to the crystal structures.},

The nonamer is most important for initial binding, while efficient nicking and hairpin formation require the heptamer sequence. Both nicking and hairpin formation are remarkably tolerant of variations in DNA structure. Certain flanking sequences inhibit hairpin formation, but this can be bypassed by base unpairing, and even a completely single-stranded signal sequence is well utilized. We suggest that DNA unpairing around the signal-coding border is essential for the initiation of V(D)J combination.},

A single somatic mutation, serine-91 of the light chain to valine, is largely responsible for the increase in affinity and catalytic activity of the affinity-matured antibody. Structural and functional studies of the germ-line precursor suggest that 39-A11 and related antibodies derive from a family of germ-line genes that have been selected throughout evolution for the ability of the encoded proteins to form a polyspecific combining site.

abstract = {Antibody catalysis provides an opportunity to examine the evolution of binding energy and its relation to catalytic function in a system that has many parallels with natural enzymes. Here we report such a study involving an antibody AZ-28 that catalyses an oxy-Cope rearrangement, a pericyclic reaction that belongs to a well studied and widely used class of reactions in organic chemistry. Immunization with transition state analogue 1 results in a germline-encoded antibody that catalyses the rearrangement of hexadiene 2 to aldehyde 3 with a rate approaching that of a related pericyclic reaction catalysed by the enzyme chorismate mutase. Affinity maturation gives antibody AZ-28, which has six amino acid substitutions, one of which results in a decrease in catalytic rate. To understand the relationship between binding and catalytic rate in this system we characterized a series of active-site mutants and determined the three-dimensional crystal structure of the complex of AZ-28 with the transition state analogue. This analysis indicates that the activation energy depends on a complex balance of several stereoelectronic effects which are controlled by an extensive network of binding interactions in the active site. Thus in this instance the combinatorial diversity of the immune system provided both an efficient catalyst for a reaction where no enzyme is known, as well as an opportunity to explore the mechanisms and evolution of biological catalysis.},

abstract = {The germline genes used by the mouse to generate the esterolytic antibody 48G7 were cloned and expressed in an effort to increase our understanding of the detailed molecular mechanisms by which the immune system evolves catalytic function. The nine replacement mutations that were fixed during affinity maturation increased affinity for the transition state analogue by a factor of 10(4), primarily the result of a decrease in the dissociation rate of the hapten-antibody complex. There was a corresponding increase in the rate of reaction of antibody with substrate, k(cat)/k(m), from 1.7 x 10(2)M(-1) min(-1) to 1.4 x 10(4)M(-1) min(-1). The three-dimensional crystal structure of the 48G7-transition state analogue complex at 2.0 angstroms resolution indicates that one of the nine residues in which somatic mutations have been fixed directly contact the hapten. Thus, in the case of 48G7, affinity maturation appears to play a conformational role, either in reorganizing the active site geometry of limiting side-chain and backbone flexibility of the germline antibody. The crystal structure and analysis of somatic and directed active site mutants underscore the role of transition state stabilization in the evolution of this catalytic antibody.},

To confirm the quaternary nature of the epitope, 2909 binding was tested against the pseudovirus SF162 wild type (WT) expressing trimers and/or an SF162 mutant expressing monomeric envelope proteins. The construction of the SF162 mutant was made by an alanine substitution of nine hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal heptad repeat region of gp41 molecules that failed to form trimers on the virus surface. Monoclonal Ab 2909 bound only to SF162 WT virions and transfected cells as determined by immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry, respectively, but showed no reactivity to the SF162 mutant expressing monomeric gp120. The data provide further evidence for the existence of a unique quaternary epitope V2/V3 on the surface of unliganded virus.},

abstract = {Although rarely elicited during natural human infection, the most broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) against diverse human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains target the membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER) of viral gp41. To gain insight into MPER antigenicity, immunogenicity, and viral function, we studied its structure in the lipid environment by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques. The analyses revealed a tilted N-terminal alpha helix (aa 664-672) connected via a short hinge to a flat C-terminal helical segment (675-683). This metastable L-shaped structure is immersed in viral membrane and, therefore, less accessible to immune attack. Nonetheless, the 4E10 BNAb extracts buried W672 and F673 after initial encounter with the surface-embedded MPER. The data suggest how BNAbs may perturb tryptophan residue-associated viral fusion involving the mobile N-terminal MPER segment and, given conservation of MPER sequences in HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV, have important implications for structure-guided vaccine design.},

abstract = {The germline precursor to the ferrochelatase antibody 7G12 was found to bind the polyether jeffamine in addition to its cognate hapten N-methylmesoporphyrin. A comparison of the X-ray crystal structures of the ligand-free germline Fab and its complex with either hapten or jeffamine reveals that the germline antibody undergoes significant conformational changes upon the binding of these two structurally distinct ligands, which lead to increased antibody-ligand complementarity. The five somatic mutations introduced during affinity maturation lead to enhanced binding affinity for hapten and a loss in affinity for jeffamine. Moreover, a comparison of the crystal structures of the germline and affinity-matured antibodies reveals that somatic mutations not only fix the optimal binding site conformation for the hapten, but also introduce interactions that interfere with the binding of non-hapten molecules. The structural plasticity of this germline antibody and the structural effects of the somatic mutations that result in enhanced affinity and specificity for hapten likely represent general mechanisms used by the immune response, and perhaps primitive proteins, to evolve high affinity, selective receptors for so many distinct chemical structures.},

abstract = {Thermodynamic and structural studies addressed the increased affinity due to L-chain somatic mutations in the HyHEL-10 family of affinity matured IgG antibodies, using ITC, SPR with van't Hoff analysis, and X-ray crystallography. When compared to the parental antibody H26L26, the H26L10 and H26L8 chimeras binding to lysozyme showed an increase in favorable DeltaG(o) of -1.2+/-0.1 kcal mol(-1) and -1.3+/-0.1 kcal mol(-1), respectively. Increase in affinity of the H26L10 chimera was due to a net increase in favorable enthalpy change with little difference in change in entropy compared to H26L26. The H26L8 chimera exhibited the greatest increase in favorable enthalpy but also showed an increase in unfavorable entropy change, with the result being that the affinities of both chimeras were essentially equivalent. Site-directed L-chain mutants identified the shared somatic mutation S30G as the dominant contributor to increasing affinity to lysozyme. This mutation was not influenced by H-chain somatic mutations. Residue 30L is at the periphery of the binding interface and S30G effects an increase in hydrophobicity and decrease in H-bonding ability and size, but does not make any new energetically important antigen contacts. A new 1.2-A structure of the H10L10-HEL complex showed changes in the pattern of both inter- and intra-molecular water bridging with no other significant structural alterations near the binding interface compared to the H26L26-HEL complex. These results highlight the necessity for investigating both the structure and the thermodynamics associated with introduced mutations, in order to better assess and understand their impact on binding. Furthermore, it provides an important example of how backbone flexibility and water-bridging may favorably influence the thermodynamics of an antibody-antigen interaction.},

abstract = {HyHEL-8, HyHEL-10, and HyHEL-26 (HH8, HH10, and HH26, respectively) are murine monoclonal IgG(1) antibodies which share over 90% variable-region amino acid sequence identity and recognize identical structurally characterized epitopes on hen egg white lysozyme (HEL). Previous immunochemical and surface plasmon resonance-based studies have shown that these antibodies differ widely in their tolerance of mutations in the epitope. While HH8 is the most cross-reactive, HH26 is rigidified by a more extensive network of intramolecular salt links and is highly specific, with both association and dissociation rates strongly affected by epitope mutations. HH10 is of intermediate specificity, and epitope mutations produce changes primarily in the dissociation rate. Calorimetric characterization of the association energetics of these three antibodies with the native antigen HEL and with Japanese quail egg white lysozyme (JQL), a naturally occurring avian variant, shows that the energetics of interaction correlate with cross-reactivity and specificity. These results suggest that the greater cross-reactivity of HH8 may be mediated by a combination of conformational flexibility and less specific intermolecular interactions. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that upon association HH8 incurs the largest configurational entropic penalty and also the smallest loss of enthalpic driving force with variant antigen. Much smaller structural perturbations are expected in the formation of the less flexible HH26 complex, and the large loss of enthalpic driving force observed with variant antigen reflects its specificity. The observed thermodynamic parameters correlate well with the observed functional behavior of the antibodies and illustrate fundamental differences in thermodynamic characteristics between cross-reactive and specific molecular recognition.},

These antibodies share over 90% sequence identity and recognize the same epitope, but differ in their degree of cross-reactivity and predicted combining site rigidity. Competitive dissociation induced by the addition of excess unlabeled HEL after varied periods of antibody-antigen association was followed in real time using fluorescence anisotropy. Dissociation was in many cases non-single-exponential, and the observed off-rates became slower as the complex age increased, suggesting multi-step association kinetics consistent with an encounter-docking view of protein-protein interactions. The fully docked fraction of the complexes just prior to inducing dissociation was high for the HEL complexes but was dramatically reduced for JQL complexes, that is final docking was antigen-sensitive. Variations among the systems can be understood in terms of the complexes' differing conformational flexibilities, based on the encounter-docking model of protein-protein associations.},

abstract = {1 NSec molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of anti-hen egg white antibody, HyHEL63 (HH63), complexed with HEL reveals important molecular interactions, not revealed in its X-ray crystal structure. These molecular interactions were predicted to be critical for the complex formation, based on structure-function studies of this complex and 3-other anti-HEL antibodies, HH8, HH10 and HH26, HEL complexes. All four antibodies belong to the same structural family, referred to here as HH10 family. Ala scanning results show that they recognize 'coincident epitopes'. 1 NSec explicit, with periodic boundary condition, MD simulation of HH63- HEL reveals the presence of functionally important saltbridges. Around 200 ps in vacuo and an additional 20 ps explicit simulation agree with the observations from 1 Nsec simulation. Intra-molecular salt-bridges predicted to play significant roles in the complex formation, were revealed during MD simulation. A very stabilizing saltbridge network, and another intra-molecular salt-bridge, at the binding site of HEL, revealed during the MD simulation, is proposed to predipose binding site geometry for specific binding. All the revealed saltbridges are present in one or more of the other three complexes and/or involve \"hot-spot\" epitope and paratope residues. Most of these charged epitope residues make large contribution to the binding free energy. The "hot spot" epitope residue Lys97Y, which significantly contributes to the free energy of binding in all the complexes, forms an intermolecular salt-bridge in several MD conformers. Our earlier computations have shown that this inter-molecular salt-bridge plays a significant role in determining specificity and flexibility of binding in the HH8-HEL and HH26-HEL complexes. Using a robust criterion of salt-bridge detection, this intermolecular salt-bridge was detected in the native structures of the HH8-HEL and HH26-HEL complexes, but was not revealed in the crystal structure of HH63-HEL complex. The electrostatic strength of this revealed saltbridge was very strong. During 1 Nsec MD simulation this salt-bridge networks with another inter-molecular salt-bridge to form an inter-molecular salt-bridge triad. Participation of Lys97Y in the formation of inter-molecular triad further validates the functional importance of Lys97Y in HH63-HEL associations. These results demonstrate that many important structural details of biomolecular interactions can be better understood when studied in a dynamic environment, and that MD simulations can complement and expand information obtained from static X-ray structure. This study also highlights "hot-spot" molecular interactions in HyHEL63-HEL complex.},

abstract = {Envelope glycoprotein (Env) spikes on AIDS retroviruses initiate infection of host cells and are therefore targets for vaccine development. Though crystal structures for partial Env subunits are known, the structure and distribution of native Env spikes on virions is obscure. We applied cryoelectron microscopy tomography to define ultrastructural details of spikes. Virions of wild-type human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and a mutant simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) had approximately 14 and approximately 73 spikes per particle, respectively, with some clustering of HIV-1 spikes. Three-dimensional averaging showed that the surface glycoprotein (gp120) 'head' of each subunit of the trimeric SIV spike contains a primary mass, with two secondary lobes. The transmembrane glycoprotein 'stalk' of each trimer is composed of three independent legs that project obliquely from the trimer head, tripod-like. Reconciling available atomic structures with the three-dimensional whole spike density map yields insights into the orientation of Env spike structural elements and possible structural bases of their functions.},

abstract = {We investigated the interaction between cross-reactive HIV-1 neutralizing human monoclonal antibody m18 and HIV-1YU-2 gp120 in an effort to understand how this antibody inhibits the entry of virus into cells. m18 binds to gp120 with high affinity (KD≈5 nM) as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). SPR analysis further showed that m18 inhibits interactions of gp120 with both soluble CD4 and CD4-induced antibodies that have epitopes overlapping the coreceptor binding site. This dual receptor site antagonism, which occurs with equal potency for both inhibition effects, argues that m18 is not functioning as a mimic of CD4, in spite of the presence of a putative CD4-like loop formed by HCDR3 in the antibody. Consistent with this view, m18 was found to interact with gp120 in the presence of saturating concentrations of a CD4-mimicking small molecule gp120 inhibitor, suggesting that m18 does not require unoccupied CD4 Phe43 binding cavity residues of gp120. Thermodynamic analysis of the m18-gp120 interaction suggests that m18 stabilizes a conformation of gp120 that is unique from and less structured than the CD4-stabilized conformation. Conformational mutants of gp120 were studied for their impact on m18 interaction. Mutations known to disrupt the coreceptor binding region and to lead to complete suppression of 17b binding had minimal effects on m18 binding. This argues that energetically important epitopes for m18 binding lie outside the disrupted bridging sheet region used for 17b and coreceptor binding. In contrast, mutations in the CD4 region strongly affected m18 binding. Overall, the results obtained in this work argue that m18, rather than mimicking CD4 directly, suppresses both receptor binding site functions of HIV-1 gp120 by stabilizing a nonproductive conformation of the envelope protein. These results can be related to prior findings about the importance of conformational entrapment as a common mode of action for neutralizing CD4bs antibodies, with differences mainly in epitope utilization and the extent of gp120 structuring.},

abstract = {Three antibodies, HyHEL-8 (HH8), HyHEL-10 (HH10), and HyHEL-26 (HH26) are specific for the same epitope on hen egg white lysozyme (HEL), and share >90% sequence homology. Their affinities vary by several orders of magnitude, and among the three antibodies, HH8 is the most cross-reactive with kinetics of binding that are relatively invariable compared to HH26, which is highly specific and has quite variable kinetics. To investigate structural correlates of these functional variations, the Fv regions of HH8 and HH26 were homology-modeled using the x-ray structure of the well-characterized HH10-HEL complex as template. The binding site of HH26 is most charged, least hydrophobic, and has the greatest number of intramolecular salt bridges, whereas that of HH8 is the least charged, most hydrophobic and has the fewest intramolecular salt bridges. The modeled HH26-HEL structure predicts the recently determined x-ray structure of HH26, (Li et al., 2003, Nat. Struct. Biol. 10:482-488) with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.03 A. It is likely that the binding site of HH26 is rendered rigid by a network of intramolecular salt bridges whereas that of HH8 is flexible due to their absence. HH26 also has the most intermolecular contacts with the antigen whereas HH8 has the least. HH10 has these properties intermediate to HH8 and HH26. The structurally rigid binding site with numerous specific contacts bestows specificity on HH26 whereas the flexible binding site with correspondingly fewer contacts enables HH8 to be cross-reactive. Results suggest that affinity maturation may select for high affinity antibodies with either "lock-and-key" preconfigured binding sites, or "preconfigured flexibility" by modulating combining site flexibility.},

abstract = {V2/V3 conformational epitope antibodies that broadly neutralize HIV-1 (PG9 and PG16) have been recently described. Since an elicitation of previously known broadly neutralizing antibodies has proven elusive, the induction of antibodies with such specificity is an important goal for HIV-1 vaccine development. A critical question is which immunogens and vaccine formulations might be used to trigger and drive the development of memory B cell precursors with V2/V3 conformational epitope specificity. In this paper we identified a clonal lineage of four V2/V3 conformational epitope broadly neutralizing antibodies (CH01 to CH04) from an African HIV-1-infected broad neutralizer and inferred their common reverted unmutated ancestor (RUA) antibodies. While conformational epitope antibodies rarely bind recombinant Env monomers, a screen of 32 recombinant envelopes for binding to the CH01 to CH04 antibodies showed monoclonal antibody (MAb) binding to the E.A244 gp120 Env and to chronic Env AE.CM243; MAbs CH01 and CH02 also bound to transmitted/founder Env B.9021. CH01 to CH04 neutralized 38% to 49% of a panel of 91 HIV-1 tier 2 pseudoviruses, while the RUAs neutralized only 16% of HIV-1 isolates. Although the reverted unmutated ancestors showed restricted neutralizing activity, they retained the ability to bind to the E.A244 gp120 HIV-1 envelope with an affinity predicted to trigger B cell development. Thus, E.A244, B.9021, and AE.CM243 Envs are three potential immunogen candidates for studies aimed at defining strategies to induce V2/V3 conformational epitope-specific antibodies.},

abstract = {HIV-1 enters a host cell after an initial interaction between viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 and cell surface receptor CD4, followed by a second interaction between gp120 and a cell surface chemokine receptor. CD4 residue Phe43 makes a significant contribution to the high-affinity interaction between CD4 and env. We and others have used scorpion toxin scaffolds to display and examine CD4 epitopes used for gp120 recognition. These peptides, which have a beta-turn Phe that acts as a Phe43 surrogate, compete with CD4 for gp120 binding and enhance the binding of gp120 to 17b, an antibody that binds near the co-receptor-binding site. In the current study, a scyllatoxin-scaffolded peptide, identified via phage epitope randomization and lacking a beta-turn Phe (indeed, containing no aromatic residues), was shown to behave in a distinctly CD4-like manner. This peptide, denoted [20EGLV23]ST, not only competed with CD4 for gp120 binding, but also enhanced the binding of gp120 to 17b. Quantitatively, an [20EGLV23]ST-gp120 complex exhibited the same 17b binding on-rate as a complex of gp120 with [20AGSF23]ST, a scyllatoxin-based CD4 mimetic peptide containing a beta-turn Phe. In view of this result, we examined the role of Phe43 in CD4 itself by comparing F43V D1D2 sCD4 versus D1D2 sCD4. Like the peptides, a close similarity was observed for both Phe43 and Phe43-less D1D2 sCD4s in enhancing gp120 binding to 17b. Further, when examined for their ability to enhance binding of gp120 to CCR5+ cells, [20EGLV23]ST and [20AGSF23]ST were found to have the same efficacy, after correcting for the difference in their gp120 affinities. These results show that, although Phe43 is important in maintaining high affinity in gp120 ligands, the aromatic residue is not necessary for triggering the conformational isomerization in gp120 that results in formation or exposure of the binding sites for the 17b antibody and the CCR5 receptor.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Antibodies (Abs) produced during HIV-1 infection rarely neutralize a broad range of viral isolates; only eight broadly-neutralizing (bNt) monoclonal (M)Abs have been isolated. Yet, to be effective, an HIV-1 vaccine may have to elicit the essential features of these MAbs. The V genes of all of these bNt MAbs are highly somatically mutated, and the V(H) genes of five of them encode a long (≥ 20 aa) third complementarity-determining region (CDR-H3). This led us to question whether long CDR-H3s and high levels of somatic mutation (SM) are a preferred feature of anti-HIV bNt MAbs, or if other adaptive immune responses elicit them in general.

METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We assembled a V(H)-gene sequence database from over 700 human MAbs of known antigen specificity isolated from chronic (viral) infections (ChI), acute (bacterial and viral) infections (AcI), and systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD), and compared their CDR-H3 length, number of SMs and germline V(H)-gene usage. We found that anti-HIV Abs, regardless of their neutralization breadth, tended to have long CDR-H3s and high numbers of SMs. However, these features were also common among Abs associated with other chronic viral infections. In contrast, Abs from acute viral infections (but not bacterial infections) tended to have relatively short CDR-H3s and a low number of SMs, whereas SAD Abs were generally intermediate in CDR-H3 length and number of SMs. Analysis of V(H) gene usage showed that ChI Abs also tended to favor distal germline V(H)-genes (particularly V(H)1-69), especially in Abs bearing long CDR-H3s.

CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE:The striking difference between the Abs produced during chronic vs. acute viral infection suggests that Abs bearing long CDR-H3s, high levels of SM and V(H)1-69 gene usage may be preferentially selected during persistent infection.},

In this study, we present a general method for assessing human antibody sequence diversity displayed on phage using massively parallel pyrosequencing, a novel application of Kabat column-labeled profile Hidden Markov Models, and translated complementarity determining region (CDR) capture-recapture analysis. Pyrosequencing of domain amplicon and RCA PCR products generated 1.5 x 10(6) reads, including more than 1.9 x 10(5) high quality, full-length sequences of antibody variable fragment (Fv) variable domains. Novel methods for germline and CDR classification and fine characterization of sequence diversity in the 6 CDRs are presented. Diverse germline contributions to the repertoire with random heavy and light chain pairing are observed. All germline families were found to be represented in 1.7 x 10(4) sequences obtained from repeated panning of the library. While the most variable CDR (CDR-H3) presents significant length and sequence variability, we find a substantial contribution to total diversity from somatically mutated germline encoded CDRs 1 and 2. Using a capture-recapture method, the total diversity of the antibody library obtained from a human donor Immunoglobulin M (IgM) pool was determined to be at least 3.5 x 10(10). The results provide insights into the role of IgM diversification, display library construction, and productive germline usages in antibody libraries and the humoral repertoire.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:V(D)J recombination is initiated by the introduction of double-stranded breaks (DSB) adjacent to recombination signal sequences (RSS). Each RSS contains a conserved heptamer and a conserved nonamer element separated by a 12 or 23 nucleotide spacer. In vivo, efficient recombination requires one RSS of each spacer length, although it has been unclear whether this '12/23 rule' regulates cleavage, joining, or both.

RESULTS:We describe a novel system that permits semiquantitative detection of DSB at RSS derived from V(D)J recombination substrates transfected into cultured cells. This approach provides a powerful new tool for analysis of the cleavage and joining steps of V(D)J recombination in vivo. In this study, substrates containing either a consensus 12/23 RSS pair or various deviations from the consensus were used to investigate the requirements for cleavage. The results show that both a 12-spacer and a 23-spacer RSS are required for efficient cleavage. Truncated RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins, while capable of cleaving at isolated RSS in cell-free systems, also require a 12/23 RSS pair for efficient cleavage in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS:These results suggest that the 12/23 rule is enforced at or prior to cleavage and support a synapsis model for V(D)J recombination. Detection of rare cleavage events in substrates containing a single RSS or a pair of RSS with the same spacer length provide evidence for an inefficient, single RSS cleavage pathway that may contribute to aberrant V(D)J rearrangements in vivo.},

abstract = {Serotonin modulates agonistic and reproductive behavior across vertebrate species. 5HT(1A) and 5HT(1B) receptors mediate many serotonergic effects on social behavior, but other receptors, including 5HT(2) receptors, may also contribute. We investigated serotonergic regulation of electrocommunication signals in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. During social interactions, these fish modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) to produce signals known as chirps. Males chirp more than females and produce two chirp types. Males produce high-frequency chirps as courtship signals; whereas both sexes produce low-frequency chirps during same-sex interactions. Serotonergic innervation of the prepacemaker nucleus, which controls chirping, is more robust in females than males. Serotonin inhibits chirping and may contribute to sexual dimorphism and individual variation in chirping. We elicited chirps with EOD playbacks and pharmacologically manipulated serotonin receptors to determine which receptors regulated chirping. We also asked whether serotonin receptor activation generally modulated chirping or more specifically targeted particular chirp types. Agonists and antagonists of 5HT(1B/1D) receptors (CP-94253 and GR-125743) did not affect chirping. The 5HT(1A) receptor agonist 8OH-DPAT specifically increased production of high-frequency chirps. The 5HT(2) receptor agonist DOI decreased chirping. Receptor antagonists (WAY-100635 and MDL-11939) opposed the effects of their corresponding agonists. These results suggest that serotonergic inhibition of chirping may be mediated by 5HT(2) receptors, but that serotonergic activation of 5HT(1A) receptors specifically increases the production of high-frequency chirps. The enhancement of chirping by 5HT(1A) receptors may result from interactions with cortisol and/or arginine vasotocin, which similarly enhance chirping and are influenced by 5HT(1A) activity in other systems.},

The antidepressant citalopram blocks SERT and thereby inhibits the transport of 5-HT. To identify key residues establishing high-affinity citalopram binding, we have built a comparative model of hSERT and Drosophila melanogaster SERT (dSERT) based on the Aquifex aeolicus leucine transporter (LeuT(Aa)) crystal structure. In this study, citalopram has been docked into the homology model of hSERT and dSERT using RosettaLigand. Our models reproduce the differential binding affinities for the R- and S-isomers of citalopram in hSERT and the impact of several hSERT mutants. Species-selective binding affinities for hSERT and dSERT also can be reproduced. Interestingly, the model predicts a hydrogen bond between E444 in transmembrane domain 8 (TM8) and Y95 in TM1 that places Y95 in a downward position, thereby removing Y95 from a direct interaction with S-citalopram. Mutation of E444D results in a 10-fold reduced binding affinity for S-citalopram, supporting the hypothesis that Y95 and E444 form a stabilizing interaction in the S-citalopram/hSERT complex.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein is the principal target of protective humoral immune responses to influenza virus infections but such antibody responses only provide efficient protection against a narrow spectrum of HA antigenic variants within a given virus subtype. Avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 are currently panzootic and pose a pandemic threat. These viruses are antigenically diverse and protective strategies need to cross protect against diverse viral clades. Furthermore, there are 16 different HA subtypes and no certainty the next pandemic will be caused by an H5 subtype, thus it is important to develop prophylactic and therapeutic interventions that provide heterosubtypic protection.

METHODS AND FINDINGS:Here we describe a panel of 13 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recovered from combinatorial display libraries that were constructed from human IgM(+) memory B cells of recent (seasonal) influenza vaccinees. The mAbs have broad heterosubtypic neutralizing activity against antigenically diverse H1, H2, H5, H6, H8 and H9 influenza subtypes. Restriction to variable heavy chain gene IGHV1-69 in the high affinity mAb panel was associated with binding to a conserved hydrophobic pocket in the stem domain of HA. The most potent antibody (CR6261) was protective in mice when given before and after lethal H5N1 or H1N1 challenge.

CONCLUSIONS:The human monoclonal CR6261 described in this study could be developed for use as a broad spectrum agent for prophylaxis or treatment of human or avian influenza infections without prior strain characterization. Moreover, the CR6261 epitope could be applied in targeted vaccine strategies or in the design of novel antivirals. Finally our approach of screening the IgM(+) memory repertoire could be applied to identify conserved and functionally relevant targets on other rapidly evolving pathogens.},

abstract = {The viruses that caused the three influenza pandemics of the twentieth century in 1918, 1957, and 1968 had distinct hemagglutinin receptor binding glycoproteins that had evolved the capacity to recognize human cell receptors. We have determined the structure of the H2 hemagglutinin from the second pandemic, the "Asian Influenza" of 1957. We compare it with the 1918 "Spanish Influenza" hemagglutinin, H1, and the 1968 "Hong Kong Influenza" hemagglutinin, H3, and show that despite its close overall structural similarity to H1, and its more distant relationship to H3, the H2 receptor binding site is closely related to that of H3 hemagglutinin. By analyzing hemagglutinins of potential H2 avian precursors of the pandemic virus, we show that the human receptor can be bound by avian hemagglutinins that lack the human-specific mutations of H2 and H3 pandemic viruses, Gln-226Leu, and Gly-228Ser. We show how Gln-226 in the avian H2 receptor binding site, together with Asn-186, form hydrogen bond networks through bound water molecules to mediate binding to human receptor. We show that the human receptor adopts a very similar conformation in both human and avian hemagglutinin-receptor complexes. We also show that Leu-226 in the receptor binding site of human virus hemagglutinins creates a hydrophobic environment near the Sia-1-Gal-2 glycosidic linkage that favors binding of the human receptor and is unfavorable for avian receptor binding. We consider the significance for the development of pandemics, of the existence of avian viruses that can bind to both avian and human receptors.},

It has been proposed that such symmetric homodimers underwent gene duplication and fusion to evolve into protein topologies that have a symmetric arrangement of secondary structure elements--"symmetric superfolds". Here, the ROSETTA protein design software was used to computationally engineer a perfectly symmetric variant of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase and its corresponding symmetric homodimer. The new protein, termed FLR, adopts the symmetric ($\beta$$\alpha$)(8) TIM-barrel superfold. The protein is soluble and monomeric and exhibits two-fold symmetry not only in the arrangement of secondary structure elements but also in sequence and at atomic detail, as verified by crystallography. When cut in half, FLR dimerizes readily to form the symmetric homodimer. The successful computational design of FLR demonstrates progress in our understanding of the underlying principles of protein stability and presents an attractive strategy for the in silico construction of larger protein domains from smaller pieces.},

The mAb F10.6.6 has an affinity constant 700 times higher than D44.1, due to a higher surface complementarity to HEL. The structure of the free form of the Fab F10.6.6 presented here allows a comparative study of the conformational changes produced upon binding to antigen. By means of structural comparison, kinetics and thermodynamics of binding and stability studies on Fab and Fv fragments of both antibodies, we have determined that the affinity maturation process of anti-protein antibodies affects the shape of the combining site and the secondary structure content of the variable domain, stabilizes the V(H)-V(L) interaction, and consequently produces an increase of the Fv domain stability, improving the binding to antigen.},

abstract = {One nanosecond molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of anti-hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) antibody HyHEL63 (HH63) complexed with HEL reveals rigid and flexible regions of the HH63 binding site. Fifty conformations, extracted from the MD trajectory at regular time intervals were superimposed on HH63-HEL X-ray crystal structure, and the root mean squared deviations (RMSDs) and deviations in Calpha atom positions between the X-ray structure and the MD conformer were measured. Residue positions showing the large deviations in both light chain and heavy chain of the antibody were same in all the MD conformers. The residue positions showing smallest deviations were same for all the conformers in the case of light chain, whereas relatively variable in the heavy chain. Positions of large and small deviations fell in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), for both heavy and light chains. The larger deviations were in CDR-2 of light and CDR-1 of heavy chain. Smaller deviations were in CDR-3 of light and CDR-2 and CDR-3 of heavy chains. The large and small deviating regions highlight flexible and rigid regions of HH63 binding site and suggest a mosaic binding mechanism, including both "induced fit" and preconfigured "lock-and-key" type of binding. Combined "induced fit" and "lock-and-key" binding would be a better definition for the formation of large complexes, which bury larger surface area on binding, as in the case of antibody-HEL complex. We further show that flexible regions, comprising mostly charged and polar residues, form intermolecular interactions with HEL, whereas rigid regions do not. Electrostatic complementarity between HH63 and HEL also imply optimized binding affinity. Flexible and rigid regions of a high-affinity antibody are selected during the affinity maturation of the antibody and have specific functional significance. The functional importance of local inherently flexible regions is to establish intermolecular contacts or they play a key role in molecular recognition, whereas local rigid regions provide the structural framework.},

Cleavage by the RAG1 AND RAG2 proteins was previously shown to demand only a single signal sequence. Here, we established conditions where 12- and 23-spacer signal sequences are both necessary for cleavage. Coupled cutting at both sites requires only the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins, but depends on the metal ion. In Mn2+, a single signal sequence supports efficient double strand cleavage, but cutting in Mg2+ requires two signal sequences and is best with the canonical 12/23 pair. Thus, the RAG proteins determine both aspects of the specificity of V(D)J recombination, the recognition of a single signal sequence and the correct 12/23 coupling in a pair of signals.},

abstract = {In an effort to gain greater insight into the evolution of the redox active, catalytic antibody 28B4, the germline genes used by the mouse to generate this antibody were cloned and expressed, and the X-ray crystal structures of the unliganded and hapten-bound germline Fab of antibody 28B4 were determined. Comparison with the previously determined structures of the unliganded and hapten-bound affinity-matured Fab [Hsieh-Wilson, L. C., Schultz, P. G., and Stevens, R. C. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93, 5363] shows that the germline antibody binds the p-nitrophenyl ring of hapten 3 in an orientation significantly different from that seen in the affinity-matured antibody, whereas the phosphonate moiety is bound in a similar mode by both antibodies. The affinity-matured antibody 28B4 has more electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with hapten 3 than the germline antibody and binds the hapten in a lock-and-key fashion. In contrast, significant conformational changes occur in the loops of CDR H3 and CDR L1 upon hapten binding to the germline antibody, consistent with the notion of structural plasticity in the germline antibody-combining site [Wedemayer, G. J., Patten, P. A., Wang, L. H., Schultz, P. G., and Stevens, R. C. (1997) Science 276, 1665]. The structural differences are reflected in the differential binding affinities of the germline Fab (K(d) = 25 microM) and 28B4 Fab (K(d) = 37 nM) to hapten 3. Nine replacement mutations were found to accumulate in the affinity-matured antibody 28B4 compared to its germline precursor. The effects of each mutation on the binding affinity of the antibody to hapten 3 were characterized in detail in the contexts of both the germline and the affinity-matured antibodies. One of the mutations, Asp95(H)Trp, leads to a change in the orientation of the bound hapten, and its presence is a prerequisite for other somatic mutations to enhance the binding affinity of the germline antibody for hapten 3. Thus, the germline antibody of 28B4 acquired functionally important mutations in a stepwise manner, which fits into a multicycle mutation, affinity selection, and clonal expansion model for germline antibody evolution. Two other antibodies, 20-1 and NZA6, with very different antigen specificities were found to be highly homologous to the germline antibody of 28B4, consistent with the notion that certain germline variable-region gene combinations can give rise to polyspecific hapten binding sites [Romesberg, F. E., Spiller, B., Schultz, P. G., and Stevens, R. C. (1998) Science 279, 1929]. The ultimate specificity of the polyspecific germline antibody appears to be defined by CDR H3 variability and subsequent somatic mutation. Insights into the evolution of antibody-combining sites provided by this and other structural studies are discussed.},

abstract = {Antibody AZ-28 was generated against the chairlike transition-state analogue (TSA) 1 and catalyzes the oxy-Cope rearrangement of substrate 2 to product 3. The germline precursor to AZ-28 catalyzes the reaction with a 35-fold higher rate (k(cat)/k(uncat) = 163 000), despite a 40-fold lower binding affinity for TSA.1 (K(D) = 670 nM). To determine the structural basis for the differences in the binding and catalytic properties of the germline and affinity-matured antibodies, the X-ray crystal structures of the unliganded and TSA.1 complex of antibody AZ-28 have been determined at 2.8 and 2.6 A resolution, respectively; the structures of the unliganded and TSA.1 complex of the germline precursor to AZ-28 were both determined at 2. 0 A resolution. In the affinity-matured antibody.hapten complex the TSA is fixed in a catalytically unfavorable conformation by a combination of van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions. The 2- and 5-phenyl substituents of TSA.1 are almost perpendicular to the cyclohexyl ring, leading to decreased orbital overlap and decreased stabilization of the putative transition state. The active site of the germline antibody appears to have an increased degree of flexibility-CDRH3 moves 4.9 A outward from the active site upon binding of TSA.1. We suggest that this conformational flexibility in the germline antibody, which results in a lower binding affinity for TSA.1, allows dynamic changes in the dihedral angle of the 2-phenyl substituent along the reaction coordinate. These conformational changes in turn lead to enhanced orbital overlap and increased catalytic rate. These studies suggest that protein and substrate dynamics play a key role in this antibody-catalyzed reaction.},

Crystallographic analyses of the 36-65 Fab with three independent dodecapeptides provided mechanistic insights into the generation of antibody diversity. While four antigen-free Fab molecules provided a quantitative description of the conformational repertoire of the antibody CDRs, three Fab molecules bound to structurally diverse peptide epitopes exhibited a common paratope conformation. Each peptide revealed spatially different footprints within the antigen-combining site. However, a conformation-specific lock involving two shared residues, which were also associated with hapten binding, was discernible. Unlike the hapten, the peptides interacted with residues that undergo somatic mutations, suggesting a possible mechanism for excluding "nonspecific" antigens during affinity maturation. The observed multiple binding modes of diverse epitopes within a common paratope conformation of a germline antibody reveal a simple, yet elegant, mechanism for expanding the primary antibody repertoire.},

abstract = {The initiation of V(D)J recombination by the recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 proteins is carefully orchestrated to ensure that antigen receptor gene assembly occurs in the appropriate cell lineage and in the proper developmental order. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of how DNA binding and cleavage by the RAG proteins are regulated by the chromatin structure and architecture of antigen receptor genes. These advances suggest novel mechanisms for both the targeting and the mistargeting of V(D)J recombination, and have implications for how these events contribute to genome instability and lymphoid malignancy.},

abstract = {The HIV-1 envelope (Env) spike (gp120(3)/gp41(3)) undergoes considerable structural rearrangements to mediate virus entry into cells and to evade the host immune response. Engagement of CD4, the primary human receptor, fixes a particular conformation and primes Env for entry. The CD4-bound state, however, is prone to spontaneous inactivation and susceptible to antibody neutralization. How does unliganded HIV-1 maintain CD4-binding capacity and regulate transitions to the CD4-bound state? To define this mechanistically, we determined crystal structures of unliganded core gp120 from HIV-1 clades B, C, and E. Notably, all of these unliganded HIV-1 structures resembled the CD4-bound state. Conformational fixation with ligand selection and thermodynamic analysis of full-length and core gp120 interactions revealed that the tendency of HIV-1 gp120 to adopt the CD4-bound conformation was restrained by the V1/V2- and V3-variable loops. In parallel, we determined the structure of core gp120 in complex with the small molecule, NBD-556, which specifically recognizes the CD4-bound conformation of gp120. Neutralization by NBD-556 indicated that Env spikes on primary isolates rarely assume the CD4-bound conformation spontaneously, although they could do so when quaternary restraints were loosened. Together, the results suggest that the CD4-bound conformation represents a "ground state" for the gp120 core, with variable loop and quaternary interactions restraining unliganded gp120 from "snapping" into this conformation. A mechanism of control involving deformations in unliganded structure from a functionally critical state (e.g., the CD4-bound state) provides advantages in terms of HIV-1 Env structural diversity and resistance to antibodies and inhibitors, while maintaining elements essential for entry.},

The germline response to a carbohydrate immunogen can be critical to survivability, with selection for antibody gene segments that both confer protection against common pathogens and retain the flexibility to adapt to new disease organisms. We show here that antibody S25-2 binds several distinct inner-core epitopes of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) by linking an inherited monosaccharide residue binding site with a subset of complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of limited flexibility positioned to recognize the remainder of an array of different epitopes. This strategy allows germline antibodies to adapt to different epitopes while minimizing entropic penalties associated with the immobilization of labile CDRs upon binding of antigen, and provides insight into the link between the genetic origin of individual CDRs and their respective roles in antigen recognition.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Recent structural results have shown that antibodies use an induced fit mechanism to recognize and bind their antigens. Here we present the crystallographically determined structure of an Fab directed against an HIV-1 peptide (Fab 50.1) in the unliganded state and compare it with the peptide-bound structure. We perform a detailed analysis of the components that contribute to enhanced antigen binding and recognition.

RESULTS:Induced fit of Fab 50.1 to its peptide antigen involves a substantial rearrangement of the third complementarity determining region loop of the heavy chain (H3), as well as a large rotation of the variable heavy (VH) chain relative to the variable light (VL) chain. Analysis of other Fab structures suggests that the extent of the surface area buried at the VL-VH interface correlates with the ability to alter antibody quaternary structure by reorientation of the VL-VH domains.

CONCLUSION:Fab 50.1 exhibits the largest conformational changes yet observed in a single antibody. These can be attributed to the flexibility of the variable region. Comparisons of new data with previous examples lend to the general conclusion that a small VL-VH interface, due in part to a short H3 loop, permits substantial alterations to the antigen-binding pocket. This has major implications for the prediction, engineering and design of antibody-combining sites.},

abstract = {Crystal structures of an Fab (NC6.8) from a murine IgG2b(kappa) antibody and its complex with a sweet-tasting, N-,N'-,N"-trisubstituted guanidine compound (NC174) have been determined by X-ray analysis. Both crystal forms are produced by a microseeding technique in polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 but the habits and space groups are very different. The native protein crystallizes as plates in the monoclinic space group C2 and the complex crystallizes as prisms in the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2. The structures were solved by molecular replacement methods, with the Fab fragments from the 4-4-20, HyHel-5 and BV04-01 antibodies as starting models. On binding of the ligand, N-(p-cyanophenyl)-N'-(diphenylmethyl)-N"-(carboxymethyl)g uan idine, the protein exhibits significant local conformational changes in the active site, particularly in the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) of the heavy chain. The ligand enters the small crevice by end-on insertion with the cyanophenyl group in the lead and the diphenyl rings partially protruding from the entrance. No strict pi-pi stacking interactions are observed. However, tyrosine L32 (CDR1), tyrosine L96 (CDR3) and tryptophan H33 (CDR1) help immobilize the cyanophenyl ring and guanido group, and tyrosine H96 moves about 4.5 A to lie between the rings of the diphenyl group. The positive charge on the guanido group is compensated by glutamic acid H50 (CDR2) while the negative charge on acetic acid is neutralized by arginine H56 (CDR2) and by hydrogen bonding with asparagine H58 (CDR2). Water molecules participate in the binding process by hydrogen bonding with the cyano and guanido groups. The mechanism of binding is a clear example of induced fit. Like hemoglobin, the NC6.8 Fab can be classified as an allosteric protein, since its overall structure is altered by the binding of a small ligand. In crystals of the native Fab the elbow bend angle is 184 degrees while in crystals of the complex the elbow angle is 153 degrees. There is also a reciprocal push-pull type of change where the heavy chain is flexed and the light chain is extended. The tail of the heavy chain, which would be connected to the Fc in an intact antibody, is displaced 19 A relative to its position in the unliganded Fab. Within the limited series of sweetener-Fab complexes we have thus far examined, only the NC174 hapten has produced such results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Crystal structures of the Fabs from an autoantibody (BV04-01) with specificity for single-stranded DNA have been determined in the presence and absence of a trinucleotide of deoxythymidylic acid, d(pT)3. Formation of the ligand-protein complex was accompanied by small adjustments in the orientations of the variable (VL and VH) domains. In addition, there were local conformational changes in the first hypervariable loop of the light chain and the third hypervariable loop of the heavy chain, which together with the domain shifts led to an improvement in the complementarity of nucleotide and Fab. The sugar-phosphate chain adopted an extended and "open" conformation, with the base, sugar, and phosphate components available for interactions with the protein. Nucleotide 1 (5'-end) was associated exclusively with the heavy chain, nucleotide 2 was shared by both heavy and light chains, and nucleotide 3 was bound by the light chain. The orientation of phosphate 1 was stabilized by hydrogen bonds with serine H52a and asparagine H53. Phosphate 2 formed an ion pair with arginine H52, but no other charge-charge interactions were observed. Insertion of the side chain of histidine L27d between nucleotides 2 and 3 resulted in a bend in the sugar-phosphate chain. The most dominant contacts with the protein involved the central thymine base, which was immobilized by cooperative stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. This base was intercalated between a tryptophan ring (no. H100a) from the heavy chain and a tyrosine ring (no. L32) from the light chain. The resulting orientation of thymine was favorable for the simultaneous formation of two hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen and the side chain hydroxyl group of serine L91 (the thymine atoms were the hydrogen on nitrogen 3 and keto oxygen 4).},

The three-dimensional structure was resolved to 2.8 A with an improved refinement and better geometry than two previously determined Fab 17/9-peptide (HA1 100-108) complexes, facilitating a detailed description of the Fab-peptide interactions. The binding pockets and the peptide antigen are structurally similar in all three peptide complexes of Fab 17/9. The peptide adopts an extended conformation (residues 100 to 103) and a type I reverse turn (residues 104 to 107). Additionally, the antigenic determinant described here correlates well with previous epitope mapping studies. The structures of the free and antigen bound Fab illustrate the role of induced fit as a mechanism for antibody-antigen recognition. Fab 17/9 undergoes a large conformational change, mainly in the H3 loop, upon peptide binding. As a result, the shape of the binding pocket changes substantially in the liganded Fab. However, the backbone conformations of the other hypervariable loops (L2, L3, H1 and H2) show no significant difference between free and bound structures. The conformation of the L1 loop is also maintained in all structures, but its position relative to the framework varies in different crystal environments. The availability of three X-ray structures of an Fab-peptide complex in three different space groups makes it possible to clearly distinguish between crystal packing and antigen binding as the cause of structural differences. Two distinct H3-loop conformations, free and bound, are observed with no evidence otherwise for multiple conformations of the hypervariable loops (CDRs) or increased flexibility in either the free or bound forms.},

Antibodies against PorA are able to induce complement-mediated bacterial killing and thereby play an important role in protection against meningococcal disease. Bactericidal antibodies are all directed against variable regions VR1 and VR2 of the PorA sequence, corresponding to loops 1 and 4 of a two-dimensional topology model of the porin with eight extracellular loops. We have determined the crystal structure to 2.6 A resolution of the Fab fragment of bactericidal antibody MN12H2 against meningococcal PorA in complex with a linear fluorescein-conjugated peptide TKDTNNNL derived from the VR2 sequence of sero-subtype P1.7,16 (residues 180-187) from meningococcal strain H44/76. The peptide folds deeply into the binding cavity of the Fab molecule in a type I beta-turn, with the minimal P1.16 epitope DTNNN virtually completely buried. The structure reveals H-bonds and van der Waals interactions with all minimal epitope residues and one essential salt bridge between Asp-182 of the peptide and His-31 of the MN12H2 light chain. The key components of the recognition of PorA epitope P1.16 by bactericidal antibody MN12H2 correspond well with available thermodynamic data from binding studies. Furthermore, they indicate the structural basis of an increased endemic incidence of infection by group B meningococci in England and Wales since 1981 associated with the occurrence of an Neisseria meningitidis escape mutant (strain-MC58). The observed three-dimensional conformation of the peptide provides a rationale for the development of a synthetic peptide vaccine against meningococcal disease.},

abstract = {Colicin endonucleases (DNases) are bound and inactivated by immunity (Im) proteins. Im proteins are broadly cross-reactive yet specific inhibitors binding cognate and non-cognate DNases with K(d) values that vary between 10(-4) and 10(-14) M, characteristics that are explained by a 'dual-recognition' mechanism. In this work, we addressed for the first time the energetics of Im protein recognition by colicin DNases through a combination of E9 DNase alanine scanning and double-mutant cycles (DMCs) coupled with kinetic and calorimetric analyses of cognate Im9 and non-cognate Im2 binding, as well as computational analysis of alanine scanning and DMC data. We show that differential DeltaDeltaGs observed for four E9 DNase residues cumulatively distinguish cognate Im9 association from non-cognate Im2 association. E9 DNase Phe86 is the primary specificity hotspot residue in the centre of the interface, which is coordinated by conserved and variable hotspot residues of the cognate Im protein. Experimental DMC analysis reveals that only modest coupling energies to Im9 residues are observed, in agreement with calculated DMCs using the program ROSETTA and consistent with the largely hydrophobic nature of E9 DNase-Im9 specificity contacts. Computed values for the 12 E9 DNase alanine mutants showed reasonable agreement with experimental DeltaDeltaG data, particularly for interactions not mediated by interfacial water molecules. DeltaDeltaG predictions for residues that contact buried water molecules calculated using solvated rotamer models met with mixed success; however, we were able to predict with a high degree of accuracy the location and energetic contribution of one such contact. Our study highlights how colicin DNases are able to utilise both conserved and variable amino acids to distinguish cognate from non-cognate Im proteins, with the energetic contributions of the conserved residues modulated by neighbouring specificity sites.},

abstract = {We describe the adaptation of the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method for prediction of helical transmembrane protein structures. The membrane environment is modeled by embedding the protein chain into a model membrane represented by parallel planes defining hydrophobic, interface, and polar membrane layers for each energy evaluation. The optimal embedding is determined by maximizing the exposure of surface hydrophobic residues within the membrane and minimizing hydrophobic exposure outside of the membrane. Protein conformations are built up using the Rosetta fragment assembly method and evaluated using a new membrane-specific version of the Rosetta low-resolution energy function in which residue-residue and residue-environment interactions are functions of the membrane layer in addition to amino acid identity, distance, and density. We find that lower energy and more native-like structures are achieved by sequential addition of helices to a growing chain, which may mimic some aspects of helical protein biogenesis after translocation, rather than folding the whole chain simultaneously as in the Rosetta soluble protein prediction method. In tests on 12 membrane proteins for which the structure is known, between 51 and 145 residues were predicted with root-mean-square deviation <4 A from the native structure.},

abstract = {MN12H2 is a bactericidal antibody directed against outer membrane protein PorA epitope P1.16 of Neisseria meningitidis. Binding of MN12H2 to PorA at the meningococcal surface activates the classical complement pathway resulting in bacterial lysis. We have determined the crystal structure of the unliganded MN12H2 Fab fragment in two different crystal forms and compared it with the structure of the Fab in complex with a P1.16-derived peptide. The unliganded Fabs have elbow bend angles of 155 degrees and 159 degrees, whereas the liganded Fab has a more closed elbow bend of 143 degrees. Substantial differences in quaternary and tertiary structure of the antigen binding site are observed between the unliganded and liganded MN12H2 Fab structures that can be attributed to peptide binding. The variable light and heavy chain interface of the liganded Fab is twisted by a 5 degrees rotation along an axis approximately perpendicular to the plane of the interface. Hypervariable loops H1, H2, and framework loop FR-H3 follow this rotation. The hypervariable loop H3 undergoes conformational changes but remains closely linked to hypervariable loop L1. In contrast with the binding site expansion seen in other Fab-peptide structures, the MN12H2 binding site is narrowed upon peptide binding due to the formation of a "false floor" mediated by arginine residue 101 of the light chain. These results indicate that PorA epitope P1.16 of N. meningitidis is recognized by the complement-activating antibody MN12H2 through induced fit, allowing the formation of a highly complementary immune complex.},

Comparisons with VRC01-gp120 revealed that a four-residue insertion in heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) contributed to increased interaction between NIH45-46 and the gp120 inner domain, which correlated with enhanced neutralization. We used structure-based design to create NIH45-46(G54W), a single substitution in CDRH2 that increases contact with the gp120 bridging sheet and improves breadth and potency, critical properties for potential clinical use, by an order of magnitude. Together with the NIH45-46-gp120 structure, these results indicate that gp120 inner domain and bridging sheet residues should be included in immunogens to elicit CD4bs antibodies.},

The RASREC Rosetta models were in good agreement with models obtained using traditional NMR methods with larger restraint sets. In five cases X-ray structures were determined or were available, allowing comparison of the accuracy of the Rosetta models and conventional NMR models. In all five cases, the Rosetta models were more similar to the X-ray structures over both the backbone and side-chain conformations than the "best effort" structures determined by conventional methods. The incorporation of sparse distance restraints into RASREC Rosetta allows routine determination of high-quality solution NMR structures for proteins up to 40 kDa, and should be broadly useful in structural biology.},

Although the measured dissociation constant was modest ( approximately 300 microM), 2D-[(1)H,(15)N]-HSQC NMR spectra of one of the designed proteins in the absence and presence of its binding partner showed clear evidence of specific dimer formation.},

abstract = {Characterization of human monoclonal antibodies is providing considerable insight into mechanisms of broad HIV-1 neutralization. Here we report an HIV-1 gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER)-specific antibody, named 10E8, which neutralizes ∼98% of tested viruses. An analysis of sera from 78 healthy HIV-1-infected donors demonstrated that 27% contained MPER-specific antibodies and 8% contained 10E8-like specificities. In contrast to other neutralizing MPER antibodies, 10E8 did not bind phospholipids, was not autoreactive, and bound cell-surface envelope. The structure of 10E8 in complex with the complete MPER revealed a site of vulnerability comprising a narrow stretch of highly conserved gp41-hydrophobic residues and a critical arginine or lysine just before the transmembrane region. Analysis of resistant HIV-1 variants confirmed the importance of these residues for neutralization. The highly conserved MPER is a target of potent, non-self-reactive neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that HIV-1 vaccines should aim to induce antibodies to this region of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.},

abstract = {The capsid (CA) protein plays crucial roles in HIV infection and replication, essential to viral maturation. The absence of high-resolution structural data on unassembled CA hinders the development of antivirals effective in inhibiting assembly. Unlike enzymes that have targetable, functional substrate-binding sites, the CA does not have a known site that affects catalytic or other innate activity, which can be more readily targeted in drug development efforts. We report the crystal structure of the HIV-1 CA, revealing the domain organization in the context of the wild-type full-length (FL) unassembled CA. The FL CA adopts an antiparallel dimer configuration, exhibiting a domain organization sterically incompatible with capsid assembly. A small compound, generated in situ during crystallization, is bound tightly at a hinge site ("H site"), indicating that binding at this interdomain region stabilizes the ADP conformation. Electron microscopy studies on nascent crystals reveal both dimeric and hexameric lattices coexisting within a single condition, in agreement with the interconvertibility of oligomeric forms and supporting the feasibility of promoting assembly-incompetent dimeric states. Solution characterization in the presence of the H-site ligand shows predominantly unassembled dimeric CA, even under conditions that promote assembly. Our structure elucidation of the HIV-1 FL CA and characterization of a potential allosteric binding site provides three-dimensional views of an assembly-defective conformation, a state targeted in, and thus directly relevant to, inhibitor development. Based on our findings, we propose an unprecedented means of preventing CA assembly, by "conformationally trapping" CA in assembly-incompetent conformational states induced by H-site binding.},

abstract = {The structure of VRC01 in complex with the HIV-1 gp120 core reveals that this broadly neutralizing CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibody partially mimics the interaction of the primary virus receptor, CD4, with gp120. Here, we extended the investigation of the VRC01-gp120 core interaction to the biologically relevant viral spike to better understand the mechanism of VRC01-mediated neutralization and to define viral elements associated with neutralization resistance. In contrast to the interaction of CD4 or the CD4bs monoclonal antibody (MAb) b12 with the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), occlusion of the VRC01 epitope by quaternary constraints was not a major factor limiting neutralization. Mutagenesis studies indicated that VRC01 contacts within the gp120 loop D, the CD4 binding loop, and the V5 region were necessary for optimal VRC01 neutralization, as suggested by the crystal structure. In contrast to interactions with the soluble gp120 monomer, VRC01 interaction with the native viral spike did not occur in a CD4-like manner; VRC01 did not induce gp120 shedding from the Env spike or enhance gp41 membrane proximal external region (MPER)-directed antibody binding to the Env spike. Finally, VRC01 did not display significant reactivity with human antigens, boding well for potential in vivo applications. The data indicate that VRC01 interacts with gp120 in the context of the functional spike in a manner distinct from that of CD4. It achieves potent neutralization by precisely targeting the CD4bs without requiring alterations of Env spike configuration and by avoiding steric constraints imposed by the quaternary structure of the functional Env spike.},

abstract = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies against highly variable viral pathogens are much sought after to treat or protect against global circulating viruses. Here we probed the neutralizing antibody repertoires of four human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected donors with remarkably broad and potent neutralizing responses and rescued 17 new monoclonal antibodies that neutralize broadly across clades. Many of the new monoclonal antibodies are almost tenfold more potent than the recently described PG9, PG16 and VRC01 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and 100-fold more potent than the original prototype HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies largely recapitulate the neutralization breadth found in the corresponding donor serum and many recognize novel epitopes on envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120, illuminating new targets for vaccine design. Analysis of neutralization by the full complement of anti-HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies now available reveals that certain combinations of antibodies should offer markedly more favourable coverage of the enormous diversity of global circulating viruses than others and these combinations might be sought in active or passive immunization regimes. Overall, the isolation of multiple HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from several donors that, in aggregate, provide broad coverage at low concentrations is a highly positive indicator for the eventual design of an effective antibody-based HIV vaccine.},

abstract = {Guided by recent experimental results suggesting that protein-folding rates and mechanisms are determined largely by native-state topology, we develop a simple model for protein folding free-energy landscapes based on native-state structures. The configurations considered by the model contain one or two contiguous stretches of residues ordered as in the native structure with all other residues completely disordered; the free energy of each configuration is the difference between the entropic cost of ordering the residues, which depends on the total number of residues ordered and the length of the loop between the two ordered segments, and the favorable attractive interactions, which are taken to be proportional to the total surface area buried by the ordered residues in the native structure. Folding kinetics are modeled by allowing only one residue to become ordered/disordered at a time, and a rigorous and exact method is used to identify free-energy maxima on the lowest free-energy paths connecting the fully disordered and fully ordered configurations. The distribution of structure in these free-energy maxima, which comprise the transition-state ensemble in the model, are reasonably consistent with experimental data on the folding transition state for five of seven proteins studied. Thus, the model appears to capture, at least in part, the basic physics underlying protein folding and the aspects of native-state topology that determine protein-folding mechanisms.},

abstract = {Recent work has shown that NMR structures can be determined by integrating sparse NMR data with structure prediction methods such as Rosetta. The experimental data serve to guide the search for the lowest energy state towards the deep minimum at the native state which is frequently missed in Rosetta de novo structure calculations. However, as the protein size increases, sampling again becomes limiting; for example, the standard Rosetta protocol involving Monte Carlo fragment insertion starting from an extended chain fails to converge for proteins over 150 amino acids even with guidance from chemical shifts (CS-Rosetta) and other NMR data. The primary limitation of this protocol--that every folding trajectory is completely independent of every other--was recently overcome with the development of a new approach involving resolution-adapted structural recombination (RASREC). Here we describe the RASREC approach in detail and compare it to standard CS-Rosetta. We show that the improved sampling of RASREC is essential in obtaining accurate structures over a benchmark set of 11 proteins in the 15-25 kDa size range using chemical shifts, backbone RDCs and HN-HN NOE data; in a number of cases the improved sampling methodology makes a larger contribution than incorporation of additional experimental data. Experimental data are invaluable for guiding sampling to the vicinity of the global energy minimum, but for larger proteins, the standard Rosetta fold-from-extended-chain protocol does not converge on the native minimum even with experimental data and the more powerful RASREC approach is necessary to converge to accurate solutions.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of loop closure, i.e., of finding the ensemble of possible backbone structures of a chain segment of a protein molecule that is geometrically consistent with preceding and following parts of the chain whose structures are given. We reduce this problem of determining the loop conformations of six torsions to finding the real roots of a 16th degree polynomial in one variable, based on the robotics literature on the kinematics of the equivalent rotator linkage in the most general case of oblique rotators. We provide a simple intuitive view and derivation of the polynomial for the case in which each of the three pair of torsional axes has a common point. Our method generalizes previous work on analytical loop closure in that the torsion angles need not be consecutive, and any rigid intervening segments are allowed between the free torsions. Our approach also allows for a small degree of flexibility in the bond angles and the peptide torsion angles; this substantially enlarges the space of solvable configurations as is demonstrated by an application of the method to the modeling of cyclic pentapeptides. We give further applications to two important problems. First, we show that this analytical loop closure algorithm can be efficiently combined with an existing loop-construction algorithm to sample loops longer than three residues. Second, we show that Monte Carlo minimization is made severalfold more efficient by employing the local moves generated by the loop closure algorithm, when applied to the global minimization of an eight-residue loop. Our loop closure algorithm is freely available at http://dillgroup. ucsf.edu/loop_closure/.},

The efficacies of a wide variety of sequence-dependent and sequence-independent features of protein structures for recognizing native-like structures were systematically evaluated using ensembles of approximately 30,000 compact conformations with fixed secondary structure for each of 17 small protein domains. The best results were obtained using a core scoring function with P(sequence/structure) parameterized similarly to our previous work (Simons et al., J Mol Biol 1997;268:209-225] and P(structure) focused on secondary structure packing preferences; while several additional features had some discriminatory power on their own, they did not provide any additional discriminatory power when combined with the core scoring function. Our results, on both the training set and the independent decoy set of Park and Levitt (J Mol Biol 1996;258:367-392), suggest that this scoring function should contribute to the prediction of tertiary structure from knowledge of sequence and secondary structure.},

The method relies on knowledge of the minimum energy path and bases the activation free energy calculation on moving along this path from a minimum to a saddle point. Use is made of a local reaction coordinate which describes the advance of the reaction in each segment of the minimum energy path. The activation free energy is formulated as a sum of two terms. The first is due to the change in the local reaction coordinate between the endpoints of each segment of the path. The second is due to the change in direction of the minimum energy path between consecutive segments. Both contributions can be obtained by molecular dynamics simulations with a constraint on the local reaction coordinate. The method is illustrated by applying it to a model potential and to the C7(eq) to C7(ax) transition in the alanine dipeptide.

abstract = {The role of antibody in protection against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) has been difficult to study in animal models because most primary HIV-1 strains do not infect nonhuman primates. Using a chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) based on the envelope of a primary isolate (HIV-89.6), we performed passive-transfer experiments in rhesus macaques to study the role of anti-envelope antibodies in protection. Based on prior in vitro data showing neutralization synergy by antibody combinations, we evaluated HIV immune globulin (HIVIG), and human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 2F5 and 2G12 given alone, compared with the double combination 2F5/2G12 and the triple combination HIVIG/2F5/2G12. Antibodies were administered 24 h prior to intravenous challenge with the pathogenic SHIV-89.6PD. Six control monkeys displayed high plasma viremia, rapid CD4(+)-cell decline, and clinical AIDS within 14 weeks. Of six animals given HIVIG/2F5/2G12, three were completely protected; the remaining three animals became SHIV infected but displayed reduced plasma viremia and near normal CD4(+)-cell counts. One of three monkeys given 2F5/2G12 exhibited only transient evidence of infection; the other two had marked reductions in viral load. All monkeys that received HIVIG, 2F5, or 2G12 alone became infected and developed high-level plasma viremia. However, compared to controls, monkeys that received HIVIG or MAb 2G12 displayed a less profound drop in CD4(+) T cells and a more benign clinical course. These data indicate a general correlation between in vitro neutralization and protection and suggest that a vaccine that elicits neutralizing antibody should have a protective effect against HIV-1 infection or disease.},

abstract = {Although quantities derived from solvent accessible surface areas (SASA) are useful in many applications in protein design and structural biology, the computational cost of accurate SASA calculation makes SASA-based scores difficult to integrate into commonly used protein design methodologies. We demonstrate a method for maintaining accurate SASA during a Monte Carlo search of sequence and rotamer space for a fixed protein backbone. We extend the fast Le Grand and Merz algorithm (Le Grand and Merz, J Comput Chem, 14, 349), which discretizes the solvent accessible surface for each atom by placing dots on a sphere and combines Boolean masks to determine which dots are exposed. By replacing semigroup operations with group operations (from Boolean logic to counting dot coverage) we support SASA updates. Our algorithm takes time proportional to the number of atoms affected by rotamer substitution, rather than the number of atoms in the protein. For design simulations with a one hundred residue protein our approach is approximately 145 times faster than performing a Le Grand and Merz SASA calculation from scratch following each rotamer substitution. To demonstrate practical effectiveness, we optimize a SASA-based measure of protein packing in the complete redesign of a large set of proteins and protein-protein interfaces.},

abstract = {De novo protein design requires the identification of amino-acid sequences that favor the target-folded conformation and are soluble in water. One strategy for promoting solubility is to disallow hydrophobic residues on the protein surface during design. However, naturally occurring proteins often have hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that contribute to protein stability via the partial burial of hydrophobic surface area or play a key role in the formation of protein-protein interactions. A less restrictive approach for surface design that is used by the modeling program Rosetta is to parameterize the energy function so that the number of hydrophobic amino acids designed on the protein surface is similar to what is observed in naturally occurring monomeric proteins. Previous studies with Rosetta have shown that this limits surface hydrophobics to the naturally occurring frequency (∼28%), but that it does not prevent the formation of hydrophobic patches that are considerably larger than those observed in naturally occurring proteins. Here, we describe a new score term that explicitly detects and penalizes the formation of hydrophobic patches during computational protein design. With the new term, we are able to design protein surfaces that include hydrophobic amino acids at naturally occurring frequencies, but do not have large hydrophobic patches. By adjusting the strength of the new score term, the emphasis of surface redesigns can be switched between maintaining solubility and maximizing folding free energy.},

Incorporating metal-binding sites at the target interface may be one approach for increasing affinity and specifying the binding mode, thereby improving robustness of designed interactions for use as tools in basic research as well as in applications from biotechnology to medicine. Here we describe a Rosetta-based approach for the rational design of a protein monomer to form a zinc-mediated, symmetric homodimer. Our metal interface design, named MID1 (NESG target ID OR37), forms a tight dimer in the presence of zinc (MID1-zinc) with a dissociation constant <30 nM. Without zinc the dissociation constant is 4 $\mu$M. The crystal structure of MID1-zinc shows good overall agreement with the computational model, but only three out of four designed histidines coordinate zinc. However, a histidine-to-glutamate point mutation resulted in four-coordination of zinc, and the resulting metal binding site and dimer orientation closely matches the computational model (C$\alpha$ rmsd = 1.4 {\AA}).},

abstract = {We have developed a protocol for identifying proteins that are predisposed to bind linear epitopes on target proteins of interest. The protocol searches through the protein database for proteins (scaffolds) that are bound to peptides with sequences similar to accessible, linear epitopes on the target protein. The sequence match is considered more significant if residues calculated to be important in the scaffold-peptide interaction are present in the target epitope. The crystal structure of the scaffold-peptide complex is then used as a template for creating a model of the scaffold bound to the target epitope. This model can then be used in conjunction with sequence optimization algorithms or directed evolution methods to search for scaffold mutations that further increase affinity for the target protein. To test the applicability of this approach we targeted three disease-causing proteins: a tuberculosis virulence factor (TVF), the apical membrane antigen (AMA) from malaria, and hemagglutinin from influenza. In each case the best scoring scaffold was tested, and binders with Kds equal to 37 $\mu$M and 50 nM for TVF and AMA, respectively, were identified. A web server (http://rosettadesign.med.unc.edu/scaffold/) has been created for performing the scaffold search process with user-defined target sequences.},

abstract = {We computationally designed a de novo protein-protein interaction between wild-type ubiquitin and a redesigned scaffold. Our strategy was to incorporate zinc at the designed interface to promote affinity and orientation specificity. A large set of monomeric scaffold surfaces were computationally engineered with three-residue zinc coordination sites, and the ubiquitin residue H68 was docked to the open coordination site to complete a tetrahedral zinc site. This single coordination bond was intended as a hotspot and polar interaction for ubiquitin binding, and surrounding residues on the scaffold were optimized primarily as hydrophobic residues using a rotamer-based sequence design protocol in Rosetta. From thousands of independent design simulations, four sequences were selected for experimental characterization. The best performing design, called Spelter, binds tightly to zinc (Kd < 10 nM) and binds ubiquitin with a Kd of 20 $\mu$M in the presence of zinc and 68 $\mu$M in the absence of zinc. Mutagenesis studies and NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments indicate that Spelter interacts with H68 and the target surface on ubiquitin, however, H68 does not form a hotspot as intended. Instead, mutation of H68 to alanine results in tighter binding. While a 3/1 zinc coordination arrangement at an interface cannot be ruled out as a means to improve affinity, our study led us to conclude that 2/2 coordination arrangements or multiple-zinc designs are more likely to promote high-affinity protein interactions.

Here, we use nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle X-ray scattering, and Rosetta modeling to reveal the structural preferences and interdomain dynamics of the MAGUK core (PDZ3-SH3-guanylate kinase) from postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), the best known MAUGK. PSD-95 is highly abundant in the postsynaptic density of excitatory neurons and is responsible for coupling glutamate receptors with internal postsynaptic structures. These solution-based studies show that the MAGUK core PDZ domain (PDZ3) interacts directly with the SH3 domain via its canonical peptide binding groove, with the connecting linker serving as an adhesive. This weak interaction, however, is dynamic and weakened further by PDZ3 ligands and linker phosphorylation, suggesting that domain dynamics may be central to MAGUK function.},

abstract = {Cell growth and differentiation are controlled by growth factor receptors coupled to the GTPase Ras. Oncogenic mutations disrupt GTPase activity, leading to persistent Ras signaling and cancer progression. Recent evidence indicates that monoubiquitination of Ras leads to Ras activation. Mutation of the primary site of monoubiquitination impairs the ability of activated K-Ras (one of the three mammalian isoforms of Ras) to promote tumor growth. To determine the mechanism of human Ras activation, we chemically ubiquitinated the protein and analyzed its function by NMR, computational modeling and biochemical activity measurements. We established that monoubiquitination has little effect on the binding of Ras to guanine nucleotide, GTP hydrolysis or exchange-factor activation but severely abrogates the response to GTPase-activating proteins in a site-specific manner. These findings reveal a new mechanism by which Ras can trigger persistent signaling in the absence of receptor activation or an oncogenic mutation.},

abstract = {The accurate design of new protein-protein interactions is a longstanding goal of computational protein design. However, most computationally designed interfaces fail to form experimentally. This investigation compares five previously described successful de novo interface designs with 158 failures. Both sets of proteins were designed with the molecular modeling program Rosetta. Designs were considered a success if a high-resolution crystal structure of the complex closely matched the design model and the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding was less than 10 $\mu$M. The successes and failures represent a wide variety of interface types and design goals including heterodimers, homodimers, peptide-protein interactions, one-sided designs (i.e., where only one of the proteins was mutated) and two-sided designs. The most striking feature of the successful designs is that they have fewer polar atoms at their interfaces than many of the failed designs. Designs that attempted to create extensive sets of interface-spanning hydrogen bonds resulted in no detectable binding. In contrast, polar atoms make up more than 40% of the interface area of many natural dimers, and native interfaces often contain extensive hydrogen bonding networks. These results suggest that Rosetta may not be accurately balancing hydrogen bonding and electrostatic energies against desolvation penalties and that design processes may not include sufficient sampling to identify side chains in preordered conformations that can fully satisfy the hydrogen bonding potential of the interface.},

abstract = {Protein design tests our understanding of protein stability and structure. Successful design methods should allow the exploration of sequence space not found in nature. However, when redesigning naturally occurring protein structures, most fixed backbone design algorithms return amino acid sequences that share strong sequence identity with wild-type sequences, especially in the protein core. This behavior places a restriction on functional space that can be explored and is not consistent with observations from nature, where sequences of low identity have similar structures. Here, we allow backbone flexibility during design to mutate every position in the core (38 residues) of a four-helix bundle protein. Only small perturbations to the backbone, 1-2 {\AA}, were needed to entirely mutate the core. The redesigned protein, DRNN, is exceptionally stable (melting point >140$\,^{\circ}$C). An NMR and X-ray crystal structure show that the side chains and backbone were accurately modeled (all-atom RMSD = 1.3 {\AA}).},

abstract = {Here we show that a recent computationally designed zinc-mediated protein interface is serendipitously capable of catalyzing carboxyester and phosphoester hydrolysis. Although the original motivation was to design a de novo zinc-mediated protein-protein interaction (called MID1-zinc), we observed in the homodimer crystal structure a small cleft and open zinc coordination site. We investigated if the cleft and zinc site at the designed interface were sufficient for formation of a primitive active site that can perform hydrolysis. MID1-zinc hydrolyzes 4-nitrophenyl acetate with a rate acceleration of 10(5) and a k(cat)/K(M) of 630 M(-1) s(-1) and 4-nitrophenyl phosphate with a rate acceleration of 10(4) and a k(cat)/K(M) of 14 M(-1) s(-1). These rate accelerations by an unoptimized active site highlight the catalytic power of zinc and suggest that the clefts formed by protein-protein interactions are well-suited for creating enzyme active sites. This discovery has implications for protein evolution and engineering: from an evolutionary perspective, three-coordinated zinc at a homodimer interface cleft represents a simple evolutionary path to nascent enzymatic activity; from a protein engineering perspective, future efforts in de novo design of enzyme active sites may benefit from exploring clefts at protein interfaces for active site placement.},

abstract = {GoLoco motif proteins bind to the inhibitory G(i) subclass of G-protein $\alpha$ subunits and slow the release of bound GDP; this interaction is considered critical to asymmetric cell division and neuro-epithelium and epithelial progenitor differentiation. To provide protein tools for interrogating the precise cellular role(s) of GoLoco motif/G$\alpha$(i) complexes, we have employed structure-based protein design strategies to predict gain-of-function mutations that increase GoLoco motif binding affinity. Here, we describe fluorescence polarization and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showing three predicted G$\alpha$(i1) point mutations, E116L, Q147L, and E245L; each increases affinity for multiple GoLoco motifs. A component of this affinity enhancement results from a decreased rate of dissociation between the G$\alpha$ mutants and GoLoco motifs. For G$\alpha$(i1)(Q147L), affinity enhancement was seen to be driven by favorable changes in binding enthalpy, despite reduced contributions from binding entropy. The crystal structure of G$\alpha$(i1)(Q147L) bound to the RGS14 GoLoco motif revealed disorder among three peptide residues surrounding a well defined Leu-147 side chain. Monte Carlo simulations of the peptide in this region showed a sampling of multiple backbone conformations in contrast to the wild-type complex. We conclude that mutation of Glu-147 to leucine creates a hydrophobic surface favorably buried upon GoLoco peptide binding, yet the hydrophobic Leu-147 also promotes flexibility among residues 511-513 of the RGS14 GoLoco peptide.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Few existing protein-protein interface design methods allow for extensive backbone rearrangements during the design process. There is also a dichotomy between redesign methods, which take advantage of the native interface, and de novo methods, which produce novel binders.

METHODOLOGY:Here, we propose a new method for designing novel protein reagents that combines advantages of redesign and de novo methods and allows for extensive backbone motion. This method requires a bound structure of a target and one of its natural binding partners. A key interaction in this interface, the anchor, is computationally grafted out of the partner and into a surface loop on the design scaffold. The design scaffold's surface is then redesigned with backbone flexibility to create a new binding partner for the target. Careful choice of a scaffold will bring experimentally desirable characteristics into the new complex. The use of an anchor both expedites the design process and ensures that binding proceeds against a known location on the target. The use of surface loops on the scaffold allows for flexible-backbone redesign to properly search conformational space.

CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE:This protocol was implemented within the Rosetta3 software suite. To demonstrate and evaluate this protocol, we have developed a benchmarking set of structures from the PDB with loop-mediated interfaces. This protocol can recover the correct loop-mediated interface in 15 out of 16 tested structures, using only a single residue as an anchor.},

abstract = {We substantiate our preliminary description of the class I tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase minimal catalytic domain with details of its construction, structure, and steady-state kinetic parameters. Generating that active fragment involved deleting 65% of the contemporary enzyme, including the anticodon-binding domain and connecting peptide 1, CP1, a 74-residue internal segment from within the Rossmann fold. We used protein design (Rosetta), rather than phylogenetic sequence alignments, to identify mutations to compensate for the severe loss of modularity, thus restoring stability, as evidenced by renaturation described previously and by 70-ns molecular dynamics simulations. Sufficient solubility to enable biochemical studies was achieved by expressing the redesigned Urzyme as a maltose-binding protein fusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters from amino acid activation assays showed that, compared with the native full-length enzyme, TrpRS Urzyme binds ATP with similar affinity. This suggests that neither of the two deleted structural modules has a strong influence on ground-state ATP binding. However, tryptophan has 10(3) lower affinity, and the Urzyme has comparably reduced specificity relative to the related amino acid, tyrosine. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed how CP1 may contribute significantly to cognate amino acid specificity. As class Ia editing domains are nested within the CP1, this finding suggests that this module enhanced amino acid specificity continuously, throughout their evolution. We call this type of reconstructed protein catalyst an Urzyme (Ur prefix indicates original, primitive, or earliest). It establishes a model for recapitulating very early steps in molecular evolution in which fitness may have been enhanced by accumulating entire modules, rather than by discrete amino acid sequence changes.},

abstract = {Computational algorithms for protein design can sample large regions of sequence space, but suffer from undersampling of conformational space and energy function inaccuracies. Experimental screening of combinatorial protein libraries avoids the need for accurate energy functions, but has limited access to vast amounts of sequence space. Here, we test if these two traditionally alternative, but potentially complementary approaches can be combined to design a variant of the ubiquitin-ligase E6AP that will bind to a nonnatural partner, the NEDD8-conjugating enzyme Ubc12. Three E6AP libraries were constructed: (i) a naive library in which all 20 amino acids were allowed at every position on the target-binding surface of E6AP (13 positions), (ii) a semidirected library that varied the same residue positions as in the naive library but disallowed mutations computationally predicted to destabilize E6AP, and (iii) a directed library that used docking and sequence optimization simulations to identify mutations predicted to be favorable for binding Ubc12. Both of the directed libraries showed > 30-fold enrichment over the naive library after the first round of screening with a split-dihydrofolate reductase complementation assay and produced multiple tight binders (K(d) < 100 nM) after four rounds of selection. Four rounds of selection with the naive library failed to produce any binders with K(d)'s lower than 50 $\mu$M. These results indicate that protein design simulations can be used to create directed libraries that are enriched in tight binders and that in some cases it is sufficient to computationally screen for well-folded sequences without explicit binding calculations.},

abstract = {We describe a computational protocol, called DDMI, for redesigning scaffold proteins to bind to a specified region on a target protein. The DDMI protocol is implemented within the Rosetta molecular modeling program and uses rigid-body docking, sequence design, and gradient-based minimization of backbone and side-chain torsion angles to design low-energy interfaces between the scaffold and target protein. Iterative rounds of sequence design and conformational optimization were needed to produce models that have calculated binding energies that are similar to binding energies calculated for native complexes. We also show that additional conformation sampling with molecular dynamics can be iterated with sequence design to further lower the computed energy of the designed complexes. To experimentally test the DDMI protocol, we redesigned the human hyperplastic discs protein to bind to the kinase domain of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). Six designs were experimentally characterized. Two of the designs aggregated and were not characterized further. Of the remaining four designs, three bound to the PAK1 with affinities tighter than 350 muM. The tightest binding design, named Spider Roll, bound with an affinity of 100 muM. NMR-based structure prediction of Spider Roll based on backbone and (13)C(beta) chemical shifts using the program CS-ROSETTA indicated that the architecture of human hyperplastic discs protein is preserved. Mutagenesis studies confirmed that Spider Roll binds the target patch on PAK1. Additionally, Spider Roll binds to full-length PAK1 in its activated state but does not bind PAK1 when it forms an auto-inhibited conformation that blocks the Spider Roll target site. Subsequent NMR characterization of the binding of Spider Roll to PAK1 revealed a comparably small binding 'on-rate' constant (<10(5) M(-1) s(-1)). The ability to rationally design the site of novel protein-protein interactions is an important step towards creating new proteins that are useful as therapeutics or molecular probes.},

abstract = {The importance of a protein-protein interaction to a signaling pathway can be established by showing that amino acid mutations that weaken the interaction disrupt signaling, and that additional mutations that rescue the interaction recover signaling. Identifying rescue mutations, often referred to as second-site suppressor mutations, controls against scenarios in which the initial deleterious mutation inactivates the protein or disrupts alternative protein-protein interactions. Here, we test a structure-based protocol for identifying second-site suppressor mutations that is based on a strategy previously described by Kortemme and Baker. The molecular modeling software Rosetta is used to scan an interface for point mutations that are predicted to weaken binding but can be rescued by mutations on the partner protein. The protocol typically identifies three types of specificity switches: knob-in-to-hole redesigns, switching hydrophobic interactions to hydrogen bond interactions, and replacing polar interactions with nonpolar interactions. Computational predictions were tested with two separate protein complexes; the G-protein Galpha(i1) bound to the RGS14 GoLoco motif, and UbcH7 bound to the ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Eight designs were experimentally tested. Swapping a buried hydrophobic residue with a polar residue dramatically weakened binding affinities. In none of these cases were we able to identify compensating mutations that returned binding to wild-type affinity, highlighting the challenges inherent in designing buried hydrogen bond networks. The strongest specificity switches were a knob-in-to-hole design (20-fold) and the replacement of a charge-charge interaction with nonpolar interactions (55-fold). In two cases, specificity was further tuned by including mutations distant from the initial design. Proteins 2010. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Metal coordination is a key structural and functional component of a large fraction of proteins. Given this dual role we considered the possibility that metal coordination may have played a templating role in the early evolution of protein folds and complexes. We describe here a rational design approach, Metal Templated Interface Redesign (MeTIR), that mimics the time course of a hypothetical evolutionary pathway for the formation of stable protein assemblies through an initial metal coordination event. Using a folded monomeric protein, cytochrome cb(562), as a building block we show that its non-self-associating surface can be made self-associating through a minimal number of mutations that enable Zn coordination. The protein interfaces in the resulting Zn-directed, D(2)-symmetrical tetramer are subsequently redesigned, yielding unique protein architectures that self-assemble in the presence or absence of metals. Aside from its evolutionary implications, MeTIR provides a route to engineer de novo protein interfaces and metal coordination environments that can be tuned through the extensive noncovalent bonding interactions in these interfaces.},

abstract = {Degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system requires assembly of a polyubiquitin chain upon substrate. However, the structural and mechanistic features that enable template-independent processive chain synthesis are unknown. We show that chain assembly by ubiquitin ligase SCF and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 is facilitated by the unusual nature of Cdc34-SCF transactions: Cdc34 binds SCF with nanomolar affinity, nevertheless the complex is extremely dynamic. These properties are enabled by rapid association driven by electrostatic interactions between the acidic tail of Cdc34 and a basic 'canyon' in the Cul1 subunit of SCF. Ab initio docking between Cdc34 and Cul1 predicts intimate contact between the tail and the basic canyon, an arrangement confirmed by crosslinking and kinetic analysis of mutants. Basic canyon residues are conserved in both Cul1 paralogs and orthologs, suggesting that the same mechanism underlies processivity for all cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. We discuss different strategies by which processive ubiquitin chain synthesis may be achieved.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the conformational preferences of N-substituted glycine peptoid oligomers. We survey the backbone conformations observed in experimentally determined peptoid structures and provide a comparison with high-level quantum mechanics calculations of short peptoid oligomers. The dominant sources of structural variation derive from: side-chain dependent cis/trans isomerization of backbone amide bonds, side chain stereochemistry, and flexibility in the psi dihedral angle. We find good agreement between the clustering of experimentally determined peptoid torsion angles and local torsional minima predicted by theory for a disarcosine model. The calculations describe a well-defined conformational map featuring distinct energy minima. The general features of the peptoid backbone conformational landscape are consistent across a range of N-alkyl glycine side chains. Alteration of side chain types, however, creates subtle but potentially significant variations in local folding propensities. We identify a limited number of low energy local conformations, which may be preferentially favored by incorporation of particular monomer units. Greater variation in backbone dihedral angles are accessible in peptoids featuring trans amide bond geometries. These results confirm that computational approaches can play a valuable role in guiding the design of complex peptoid architectures and may lead to strategies for introducing constraints that select among a limited number of low energy local conformations.},

abstract = {The precise spatio-temporal dynamics of protein activity are often critical in determining cell behaviour, yet for most proteins they remain poorly understood; it remains difficult to manipulate protein activity at precise times and places within living cells. Protein activity has been controlled by light, through protein derivatization with photocleavable moieties or using photoreactive small-molecule ligands. However, this requires use of toxic ultraviolet wavelengths, activation is irreversible, and/or cell loading is accomplished via disruption of the cell membrane (for example, through microinjection). Here we have developed a new approach to produce genetically encoded photoactivatable derivatives of Rac1, a key GTPase regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics in metazoan cells. Rac1 mutants were fused to the photoreactive LOV (light oxygen voltage) domain from phototropin, sterically blocking Rac1 interactions until irradiation unwound a helix linking LOV to Rac1. Photoactivatable Rac1 (PA-Rac1) could be reversibly and repeatedly activated using 458- or 473-nm light to generate precisely localized cell protrusions and ruffling. Localized Rac activation or inactivation was sufficient to produce cell motility and control the direction of cell movement. Myosin was involved in Rac control of directionality but not in Rac-induced protrusion, whereas PAK was required for Rac-induced protrusion. PA-Rac1 was used to elucidate Rac regulation of RhoA in cell motility. Rac and Rho coordinate cytoskeletal behaviours with seconds and submicrometre precision. Their mutual regulation remains controversial, with data indicating that Rac inhibits and/or activates Rho. Rac was shown to inhibit RhoA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, with inhibition modulated at protrusions and ruffles. A PA-Rac crystal structure and modelling revealed LOV-Rac interactions that will facilitate extension of this photoactivation approach to other proteins.},

Several studies have shown that reducing the desolvation costs for binding while preserving shape complimentarity and hydrogen bonding is an effective strategy for improving binding affinities. In favorable cases specificity has been designed by focusing only on interactions with the target protein, while in cases with closely related off-target proteins it has been necessary to explicitly disfavor unwanted binding partners.

abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that ubiquitination serves as a protein trafficking signal in addition to its well characterized role in promoting protein degradation. The yeast G protein alpha subunit Gpa1 represents a rare example of a protein that undergoes both mono- and poly-ubiquitination. Whereas mono-ubiquitinated Gpa1 is targeted to the vacuole, poly-ubiquitinated Gpa1 is directed instead to the proteasome. Here we investigate the structural requirements for mono- and poly-ubiquitination of Gpa1. We find that variants of Gpa1 engineered to be unstable are more likely to be poly-ubiquitinated and less likely to be mono-ubiquitinated. In addition, mutants that cannot be myristoylated are no longer mono-ubiquitinated but are still polyubiquitinated. Finally, we show that the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 is necessary for Gpa1 mono-ubiquitination in vivo and that the purified enzyme is sufficient to catalyze Gpa1 mono-ubiquitination in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that mono- and poly-ubiquitination have distinct enzyme and substrate recognition requirements; whereas poly-ubiquitination targets misfolded protein for degradation, a distinct ubiquitination apparatus targets the fully mature, fully myristoylated G protein for mono-ubiquitination and delivery to the vacuole.},

It is unclear whether most designs are failing because the designed sequences do not have favorable energies in the target conformations or whether more emphasis should be placed on negative design, that is, explicitly identifying sequences that have poor energies when adopting undesired conformations. We tested whether we could redesign the sequence of a naturally occurring beta sheet protein, tenascin, with a design algorithm that does not include explicit negative design. Denaturation experiments indicate that the designs are significantly more stable than the wild-type protein and the crystal structure of one design closely matches the design model. These results suggest that extensive negative design is not required to create well-folded beta sandwich proteins. However, it is important to note that negative design elements may be encoded in the conformation of the protein backbone which was preserved from the wild-type protein.},

abstract = {Amino acid side chains adopt a discrete set of favorable conformations typically referred to as rotamers. The relative energies of rotamers partially determine which side chain conformations are more often observed in protein structures and accurate estimates of these energies are important for predicting protein structure and designing new proteins. Protein modelers typically calculate side chain rotamer energies by using molecular mechanics (MM) potentials or by converting rotamer probabilities from the protein database (PDB) into relative free energies. One limitation of the knowledge-based energies is that rotamer preferences observed in the PDB can reflect internal side chain energies as well as longer-range interactions with the rest of the protein. Here, we test an alternative approach for calculating rotamer energies. We use three different quantum mechanics (QM) methods (second order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2), density functional theory (DFT) energy calculation using the B3LYP functional, and Hartree-Fock) to calculate the energy of amino acid rotamers in a dipeptide model system, and then use these pre-calculated values in side chain placement simulations. Energies were calculated for over 36,000 different conformations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine dipeptides with backbone torsion angles from the helical and strand regions of the Ramachandran plot. In a subset of cases these energies differ significantly from those calculated with standard molecular mechanics potentials or those derived from PDB statistics. We find that in these cases the energies from the QM methods result in more accurate placement of amino acid side chains in structure prediction tests.},

Unliganded MD trajectories of the pretransition-state complex with Mg(2+)ATP and the (post) transition-state analog complex with adenosine tetraphosphate relax rapidly in opposite directions, the former regressing, the latter progressing along the structural reaction coordinate. The two crystal structures (rmsd 0.7 A) therefore lie on opposite sides of a conformational free-energy maximum as the chemical transition state forms. SNAPP analysis illustrates the complexity of the associated long-range conformational coupling. Switching interactions in four nonpolar core regions are locally isoenergetic throughout the transition. Different configurations, however, propagate their effects to unfavorable, longer-range interactions at the molecular surface. Designed mutation shows that switching interactions enhance the rate, perhaps by destabilizing the ground state immediately before the transition state and limiting nonproductive diffusion before and after the chemical transition state, thereby reducing the activation entropy. This paradigm may apply broadly to energy-transducing enzymes.},

abstract = {The ability to manipulate protein binding affinities is important for the development of proteins as biosensors, industrial reagents, and therapeutics. We have developed a structure-based method to rationally predict single mutations at protein-protein interfaces that enhance binding affinities. The protocol is based on the premise that increasing buried hydrophobic surface area and/or reducing buried hydrophilic surface area will generally lead to enhanced affinity if large steric clashes are not introduced and buried polar groups are not left without a hydrogen bond partner. The procedure selects affinity enhancing point mutations at the protein-protein interface using three criteria: (1) the mutation must be from a polar amino acid to a non-polar amino acid or from a non-polar amino acid to a larger non-polar amino acid, (2) the free energy of binding as calculated with the Rosetta protein modeling program should be more favorable than the free energy of binding calculated for the wild-type complex and (3) the mutation should not be predicted to significantly destabilize the monomers. The performance of the computational protocol was experimentally tested on two separate protein complexes; Galpha(i1) from the heterotrimeric G-protein system bound to the RGS14 GoLoco motif, and the E2, UbcH7, bound to the E3, E6AP from the ubiquitin pathway. Twelve single-site mutations that were predicted to be stabilizing were synthesized and characterized in the laboratory. Nine of the 12 mutations successfully increased binding affinity with five of these increasing binding by over 1.0 kcal/mol. To further assess our approach we searched the literature for point mutations that pass our criteria and have experimentally determined binding affinities. Of the eight mutations identified, five were accurately predicted to increase binding affinity, further validating the method as a useful tool to increase protein-protein binding affinities.},

abstract = {The conjugation of ubiquitin to substrates requires a series of enzymatic reactions consisting of an activating enzyme (E1), conjugating enzymes (E2) and ligases (E3). Tagging the appropriate substrate with ubiquitin is achieved by specific E2-E3 and E3-substrate interactions. E6AP, a member of the HECT family of E3s, has been previously shown to bind and function with the E2s UbcH7 and UbcH8. To decipher the sequence determinants of this specificity we have developed a quantitative E2-E3 binding assay based on fluorescence polarization and used this assay to measure the affinity of wild-type and mutant E2-E6AP interactions. Alanine scanning of the E6AP-UbcH7 binding interface identified four side-chains on UbcH7 and six side-chains on E6AP that contribute more than 1 kcal/mol to the binding free energy. Two of the hot spot residues from UbcH7 (K96 and K100) are conserved in UbcH8 but vary across other E2s. To determine if these are key specificity determining residues, we attempted to induce a tighter association between the E2 UbcH5b and E6AP by mutating the corresponding positions in UbcH5b to lysine residues. Surprisingly, the mutations had little effect, but rather a mutation at UbcH7 position 4, which is not at a hot spot on the UbcH7-E6AP interface, significantly strengthened UbcH5bs affinity for E6AP. This result indicates that E2-E3 binding specificities are a function of both favorable interactions that promote binding, and unfavorable interactions that prevent binding with unwanted partners.},

This problem is compounded as the 20 contemporary aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases belong to two quite distinct families. We describe here the use of protein design to show experimentally that a minimal class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase active site might have functioned in the distant past. We deleted the anticodon binding domain from tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase and fused the discontinuous segments comprising its active site. The resulting 130 residue minimal catalytic domain activates tryptophan. This residual catalytic activity constitutes the first experimental evidence that the conserved class I signature sequences, HIGH and KMSKS, might have arisen in-frame, opposite motifs 2 and 1 from class II, as complementary sense and antisense strands of the same ancestral gene.},

abstract = {Recent efforts to design de novo or redesign the sequence and structure of proteins using computational techniques have met with significant success. Most, if not all, of these computational methodologies attempt to model atomic-level interactions, and hence high-resolution structural characterization of the designed proteins is critical for evaluating the atomic-level accuracy of the underlying design force-fields. We previously used our computational protein design protocol RosettaDesign to completely redesign the sequence of the activation domain of human procarboxypeptidase A2. With 68% of the wild-type sequence changed, the designed protein, AYEdesign, is over 10 kcal/mol more stable than the wild-type protein. Here, we describe the high-resolution crystal structure and solution NMR structure of AYEdesign, which show that the experimentally determined backbone and side-chains conformations are effectively superimposable with the computational model at atomic resolution. To isolate the origins of the remarkable stabilization, we have designed and characterized a new series of procarboxypeptidase mutants that gain significant thermodynamic stability with a minimal number of mutations; one mutant gains more than 5 kcal/mol of stability over the wild-type protein with only four amino acid changes. We explore the relationship between force-field smoothing and conformational sampling by comparing the experimentally determined free energies of the overall design and these focused subsets of mutations to those predicted using modified force-fields, and both fixed and flexible backbone sampling protocols.},

abstract = {We recently used computational protein design to create an extremely stable, globular protein, Top7, with a sequence and fold not observed previously in nature. Since Top7 was created in the absence of genetic selection, it provides a rare opportunity to investigate aspects of the cellular protein production and surveillance machinery that are subject to natural selection. Here we show that a portion of the Top7 protein corresponding to the final 49 C-terminal residues is efficiently mis-translated and accumulates at high levels in Escherichia coli. We used circular dichroism, size-exclusion chromatography, small-angle X-ray scattering, analytical ultra-centrifugation, and NMR spectroscopy to show that the resulting C-terminal fragment (CFr) protein adopts a compact, extremely stable, homo-dimeric structure. Based on the solution structure, we engineered an even more stable variant of CFr by disulfide-induced covalent circularisation that should be an excellent platform for design of novel functions. The accumulation of high levels of CFr exposes the high error rate of the protein translation machinery. The rarity of correspondingly stable fragments in natural proteins coupled with the observation that high quality ribosome binding sites are found to occur within E. coli protein-coding regions significantly less often than expected by random chance implies a stringent evolutionary pressure against protein sub-fragments that can independently fold into stable structures. The symmetric self-association between two identical mis-translated CFr sub-domains to generate an extremely stable structure parallels a mechanism for natural protein-fold evolution by modular recombination of protein sub-structures.},

abstract = {G-proteins cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, serving as molecular switches that coordinate cellular signaling.

T., Jones, M. B., Blaesius, R., Watts, V. J., Harden, T. K., Sondek, J., Ramer, J. K., and Siderovski, D. P. (2005) Structure 13, 1069-1080]. Here we describe the structural features and functions of KB-1753, a peptide that binds selectively to GDP x AlF4(-)- and GTPgammaS-bound states of G alpha(i) subunits. KB-1753 blocks interaction of G alpha(transducin) with its effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase, and inhibits transducin-mediated activation of cGMP degradation. Additionally, KB-1753 interferes with RGS protein binding and resultant GAP activity. A fluorescent KB-1753 variant was found to act as a sensor for activated G alpha in vitro. The crystal structure of KB-1753 bound to G alpha(i1) x GDP x AlF4(-) reveals binding to a conserved hydrophobic groove between switch II and alpha3 helices and, along with supporting biochemical data and previous structural analyses, supports the notion that this is the site of effector interactions for G alpha(i) subunits.},

To design new proteins that can switch conformation, protein designers have focused on the two key components of protein switches: the amino acid sequence must be compatible with the multiple target states and there must be a mechanism for perturbing the relative stability of these states. Proteins have been designed that can switch between folded and disordered states, between distinct folded states and between different aggregation states. A variety of trigger mechanisms have been used, including pH shifts, post-translational modification and ligand binding. Recently, computational protein design methods have been applied to switch design.

abstract = {Loss of side-chain conformational entropy is an important force opposing protein folding and the relative preferences of the amino acids for being buried or solvent exposed may be partially determined by which amino acids lose more side-chain entropy when placed in the core of a protein. To investigate these preferences, we have incorporated explicit modeling of side-chain entropy into the protein design algorithm, RosettaDesign. In the standard version of the program, the energy of a particular sequence for a fixed backbone depends only on the lowest energy side-chain conformations that can be identified for that sequence. In the new model, the free energy of a single amino acid sequence is calculated by evaluating the average energy and entropy of an ensemble of structures generated by Monte Carlo sampling of amino acid side-chain conformations. To evaluate the impact of including explicit side-chain entropy, sequences were designed for 110 native protein backbones with and without the entropy model. In general, the differences between the two sets of sequences are modest, with the largest changes being observed for the longer amino acids: methionine and arginine. Overall, the identity between the designed sequences and the native sequences does not increase with the addition of entropy, unlike what is observed when other key terms are added to the model (hydrogen bonding, Lennard-Jones energies, and solvation energies). These results suggest that side-chain conformational entropy has a relatively small role in determining the preferred amino acid at each residue position in a protein.},

The algorithm consists of an outer loop, in which sequence space is sampled by a Monte Carlo search with simulated annealing, and an inner loop, in which the effect of a given mutation is evaluated on the various target structures by using the rotamer packing routine and composite energy function of the protein design software, RosettaDesign. We have experimentally tested the method by designing a peptide, Sw2, which can be switched from a 2Cys-2His zinc finger-like fold to a trimeric coiled-coil fold, depending upon the pH or the presence of transition metals. Physical characterization of Sw2 confirms that it is able to reversibly adopt each intended target fold.},

abstract = {Over the past 10 years there has been tremendous success in the area of computational protein design. Protein design software has been used to stabilize proteins, solubilize membrane proteins, design intermolecular interactions, and design new protein structures. A key motivation for these studies is that they test our understanding of protein energetics and structure. De novo design of novel structures is a particularly rigorous test because the protein backbone must be designed in addition to the amino acid side chains. A priori it is not guaranteed that the target backbone is even designable. To address this issue, researchers have developed a variety of methods for generating protein-like scaffolds and for optimizing the protein backbone in conjunction with the amino acid sequence. These protocols have been used to design proteins from scratch and to explore sequence space for naturally occurring protein folds.},

Broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (BnAbs) from those subjects who do produce them after years of chronic HIV-1 infection have one or more unusual characteristics, including polyreactivity for host antigens, extensive somatic hypermutation and long, variable heavy-chain third complementarity-determining regions, factors that may limit their expression by host immunoregulatory mechanisms. The isolation of BnAbs from HIV-1-infected subjects and the use of computationally derived clonal lineages as templates provide a new path for HIV-1 vaccine immunogen design. This approach, which should be applicable to many infectious agents, holds promise for the construction of vaccines that can drive B cells along rare but desirable maturation pathways.},

We then describe a "solvated rotamer" approach to efficiently predict the positions of water molecules, at protein-protein interfaces and in monomeric proteins, that is compatible with widely used rotamer-based side-chain packing and protein design algorithms. Finally, we examine the extent to which the predicted water molecules can be used to improve prediction of amino acid identities and protein-protein interface stability, and discuss avenues for overcoming current limitations of the approach.},

We evaluated the extent to which a variety of all-atom energy functions could identify the native and close-to-native structures in the new decoy sets. Of various implicit solvent models, we found that a solvent-accessible surface area-based solvation provided the best enrichment and discrimination of close-to-native decoys. The combination of this solvation treatment with Lennard Jones terms and the original Rosetta energy provided better enrichment and discrimination than any of the individual terms. The results also highlight the differences in accuracy of NMR and X-ray crystal structures: a large energy gap was observed between native and non-native conformations for X-ray structures but not for NMR structures.},

Synthetic genes for ten completely redesigned proteins were generated, and the proteins were expressed, purified, and then characterized using circular dichroism, chemical and temperature denaturation and NMR experiments. Although high-resolution structures have not yet been determined, eight of these proteins appear to be folded and their circular dichroism spectra are similar to those of their wild-type counterparts. Six of the proteins have stabilities equal to or up to 7kcal/mol greater than their wild-type counterparts, and four of the proteins have NMR spectra consistent with a well-packed, rigid structure. These encouraging results indicate that the computational protein design methods can, with significant reliability, identify amino acid sequences compatible with a target protein backbone.},

To test the structural accuracy of our design algorithm and to provide insights to the dramatic changes in the kinetics and thermodynamics of folding, we have now determined the crystal structures of NuG1 and NuG2 to 1.8 A and 1.85 A, respectively. We find that they adopt hairpin structures that are closer to the computational models than to wild-type protein G; the RMSD of the NuG1 hairpin to the design model and the wild-type structure are 1.7 A and 5.1 A, respectively. The crystallographic B factor in the redesigned first hairpin of NuG1 is systematically higher than the second hairpin, suggesting that the redesigned region is somewhat less rigid. A second round of structure-based design yielded new variants of NuG1 and NuG2, which are further stabilized by 0.5 kcal/mole and 0.9 kcal/mole.},

Two variants containing 12 and 14 mutations were found to be as stable as wild-type protein L. The crystal structure of one of the variants has been solved at a resolution of 1.9 A, and the backbone conformation in the second turn is remarkably close to that of the in silico model (1.1 A RMSD) while it differs significantly from that of wild-type protein L (the turn residues are displaced by an average of 7.2 A).

By using this modified network, together with tertiary structure information from native structures, the Q3-prediction accuracy is increased by 7-10% on average and by up to 35% in individual cases for independent test data. By using tertiary structure information from models generated with the ROSETTA de novo tertiary structure prediction method, the Q3-prediction accuracy is improved by 4-5% on average for small and medium-sized single-domain proteins. Analysis of proteins with particularly large improvements in secondary structure prediction using tertiary structure information provides insight into the feedback from tertiary to secondary structure.},

In the past, only four broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies had been defined, but more than a dozen monoclonal antibodies of substantial breadth have more recently been isolated. An understanding of their recognition sites, the structural basis of their interaction with the HIV Env, and their development pathways provides new opportunities to design vaccine candidates that will elicit broadly protective antibodies against this virus.},

In this article, we review the existing literature regarding pH1N1 virus infection in HIV-infected adults, which suggests that susceptibility to pH1N1 virus infection and severity of influenza illness are likely not increased in HIV-infected adults without advanced immunosuppression or comorbid conditions. The risk of influenza-related complications, however, may be increased in those with advanced immunosuppression or high-risk comorbid conditions. Prevention and treatment of high-risk comorbid conditions and annual influenza vaccination should continue to be part of HIV clinical care to help prevent influenza illness and complications. Additional information about pH1N1 vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in HIV-infected patients would be useful to guide strategies to prevent influenza virus infection in this population.},

Thymocytes from scid mice contain broken DNA molecules at the TCR delta locus that have coding ends, as well as molecules with signal ends, whereas in normal mice we previously detected only signal ends. Remarkably, these coding (but not signal) ends are sealed into hairpin structures. The formation of hairpins at coding ends may be a universal, early step in V(D)J recombination; this would provide a simple explanation for the origin of P nucleotides in coding joints. These findings may shed light on the mechanism of cleavage and suggest a possible role for the scid factor.},

Favorable interactions between disembodied amino acid residues and the target surface are identified and used to anchor de novo designed interfaces. The method was used to design proteins that bind a conserved surface patch on the stem of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus. After affinity maturation, two of the designed proteins, HB36 and HB80, bind H1 and H5 HAs with low nanomolar affinity. Further, HB80 inhibits the HA fusogenic conformational changes induced at low pH. The crystal structure of HB36 in complex with 1918/H1 HA revealed that the actual binding interface is nearly identical to that in the computational design model. Such designed binding proteins may be useful for both diagnostics and therapeutics.},

abstract = {Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes are assembled during lymphocyte development by a novel, highly regulated series of gene rearrangement reactions known as V(D)J recombination. All rearranging loci are flanked by conserved heptamer-nonamer recombination signal sequences. Gene rearrangement results in the imprecise fusion of coding sequences and the precise fusion of signal sequences. DNA molecules with double-stranded breaks near signal sequences have been detected in cells undergoing V(D)J recombination of the TCR delta locus. We have devised a ligation-mediated PCR assay that detects broken-ended molecules in purified genomic DNA. Using this assay we found that DNA breaks occurring precisely at the signal sequence-coding sequence junction are a general feature of V(D)J recombination, appearing in association with each type of rearranging immunoglobulin gene segment. We show that a significant fraction of these broken ends are blunt and 5'-phosphorylated. In addition, detection of these broken-ended signal sequences is dependent on the activity of RAG-1 and RAG-2, and is restricted to the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. The pattern of broken-ended molecules detected in cells at various stages of development reflects the activity of the V(D)J recombinase at different loci during B- and T-cell development.},

The mechanism requires precise cutting of the DNA at segment boundaries followed by rejoining of particular pairs of the resulting termini. The imprecision of aspects of the joining reaction contributes significantly to increasing the variability of the resulting functional genes. Signal sequences target DNA recombination and must participate in a highly ordered protein-DNA complex in order to limit recombination to appropriate partners. Two proteins, RAG1 and RAG2, together form the nuclease that cleaves the DNA at the border of the signal sequences.

An improved version of the method that uses gradient-based minimization for off-rotamer side-chain optimization and includes information from unbound structures was used to create predictions for Rounds 4 and 5 of CAPRI. First, large numbers of independent MCM trajectories were carried out and the lowest free energy docked configurations identified. Second, new trajectories were started from these lowest energy structures to thoroughly sample the surrounding conformation space, and the lowest energy configurations were submitted as predictions. For all cases in which there were no significant backbone conformational changes, a small number of very low-energy configurations were identified in the first, global search and subsequently found to be close to the center of the basin of attraction in the free energy landscape in the second, local search. Following the release of the experimental coordinates, it was found that the centers of these free energy minima were remarkably close to the native structures in not only the rigid-body orientation but also the detailed conformations of the side-chains. Out of 8 targets, the lowest energy models had interface root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) less than 1.1 A from the correct structures for 6 targets, and interface RMSDs less than 0.4 A for 3 targets. The predictions were top submissions to CAPRI for Targets 11, 12, 14, 15, and 19. The close correspondence of the lowest free energy structures found in our searches to the experimental structures suggests that our free energy function is a reasonable representation of the physical chemistry, and that the real space search with full side-chain flexibility to some extent solves the protein-protein docking problem in the absence of significant backbone conformational changes. On the other hand, the approach fails when there are significant backbone conformational changes as the steric complementarity of the 2 proteins cannot be modeled without incorporating backbone flexibility, and this is the major goal of our current work.},

We describe a rapid computational approach that identified three mutations within a model enzyme that produced a 10 degrees C increase in apparent melting temperature T(m) and a 30-fold increase in half-life at 50 degrees C, with no reduction in catalytic efficiency. The effects of the mutations were synergistic, giving an increase in excess of the sum of their individual effects. The redesigned enzyme induced an increased, temperature-dependent bacterial growth rate under conditions that required its activity, thereby coupling molecular and metabolic engineering.},

abstract = {The Rosetta de novo enzyme design protocol has been used to design enzyme catalysts for a variety of chemical reactions, and in principle can be applied to any arbitrary chemical reaction of interest. The process has four stages: 1) choice of a catalytic mechanism and corresponding minimal model active site, 2) identification of sites in a set of scaffold proteins where this minimal active site can be realized, 3) optimization of the identities of the surrounding residues for stabilizing interactions with the transition state and primary catalytic residues, and 4) evaluation and ranking the resulting designed sequences. Stages two through four of this process can be carried out with the Rosetta package, while stage one needs to be done externally. Here, we demonstrate how to carry out the Rosetta enzyme design protocol from start to end in detail using for illustration the triosephosphate isomerase reaction.},

abstract = {Delineation of antibody epitopes at the residue level is key to understanding antigen resistance mutations, designing epitope-specific probes for antibody isolation, and developing epitope-based vaccines. Ideally, epitope residues are determined in the context of atomic-level structure of the antibody-antigen complex, though structure determination may in many cases be impractical. Here we describe an efficient computational method to predict antibody-specific HIV-1 envelope (Env) epitopes at the residue level, based on neutralization panels of diverse viral strains. The method primarily utilizes neutralization potency data over a set of diverse viral strains representing the antigen, and enhanced accuracy could be achieved by incorporating information from the unbound structure of the antigen. The method was evaluated on 19 HIV-1 Env antibodies with neutralization panels comprising 181 diverse viral strains and with available antibody-antigen complex structures. Prediction accuracy was shown to significantly improve over random selection with an average of greater than 8-fold enrichment of true positives at the 0.05 false positive rate level. The method was used to prospectively predict epitope residues for two HIV-1 antibodies, 8ANC131 and 8ANC195, for which predictions were validated experimentally. The method is inherently applicable to antigens that exhibit sequence diversity, and its accuracy was found to correlate inversely with sequence conservation of the epitope. Together the results show how knowledge inherent to a neutralization panel and unbound antigen structure can be utilized for residue-level prediction of antibody epitopes.},

abstract = {Molecular replacement procedures, which search for placements of a starting model within the crystallographic unit cell that best account for the measured diffraction amplitudes, followed by automatic chain tracing methods, have allowed the rapid solution of large numbers of protein crystal structures. Despite extensive work, molecular replacement or the subsequent rebuilding usually fail with more divergent starting models based on remote homologues with less than 30% sequence identity. Here we show that this limitation can be substantially reduced by combining algorithms for protein structure modelling with those developed for crystallographic structure determination. An approach integrating Rosetta structure modelling with Autobuild chain tracing yielded high-resolution structures for 8 of 13 X-ray diffraction data sets that could not be solved in the laboratories of expert crystallographers and that remained unsolved after application of an extensive array of alternative approaches. We estimate that the new method should allow rapid structure determination without experimental phase information for over half the cases where current methods fail, given diffraction data sets of better than 3.2 {\AA} resolution, four or fewer copies in the asymmetric unit, and the availability of structures of homologous proteins with >20% sequence identity.},

Peripheral B-cell populations are subject to both negative and positive selection events in the course of their development that have the potential to shape the BCR repertoire. The origin of IgM(+)IgD(+)CD27(+) (IgM memory) cells is controversial. It has been suggested that they may be a prediversified, antigen-independent, population of cells or that they are a population of cells that develop in response to T-independent antigens. Most recently, it was suggested that the majority of IgM memory cells are directly related to switched memory cells and are early emigrants from the germinal center reaction. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled us to undertake large scale IGH repertoire analysis of transitional, naive, IgM memory and switched memory B-cell populations. We find that the memory B-cell repertoires differ from the transitional and naive repertoires, and that the IgM memory repertoire is distinct from that of class-switched memory. Thus we conclude that a large proportion of IgM memory cells develop in response to different stimuli than for class-switched memory cell development.},

abstract = {A challenge to antibody engineering is the large number of positions and nature of variation and opposing concerns of introducing unfavorable biochemical properties. While large libraries are quite successful in identifying antibodies with improved binding or activity, still only a fraction of possibilities can be explored and that would require considerable effort. The vast array of natural antibody sequences provides a potential wealth of information on (1) selecting hotspots for variation, and (2) designing mutants to mimic natural variations seen in hotspots. The human immune system can generate an enormous diversity of immunoglobulins against an almost unlimited range of antigens by gene rearrangement of a limited number of germline variable, diversity and joining genes followed by somatic hypermutation and antigen selection. All the antibody sequences in NCBI database can be assigned to different germline genes. As a result, a position specific scoring matrix for each germline gene can be constructed by aligning all its member sequences and calculating the amino acid frequencies for each position. The position specific scoring matrix for each germline gene characterizes "hotspots" and the nature of variations, and thus reduces the sequence space of exploration in antibody engineering. We have developed a bioinformatics pipeline to conduct analysis of human antibody sequences, and generated a comprehensive knowledge database for in silico antibody engineering. The pipeline is fully automatic and the knowledge database can be refreshed anytime by re-running the pipeline. The refresh process is fast, typically taking 1min on a Lenovo ThinkPad T60 laptop with 3G memory. Our knowledge database consists of (1) the individual germline gene usage in generation of natural antibodies; (2) the CDR length distributions; and (3) the position specific scoring matrix for each germline gene. The knowledge database provides comprehensive support for antibody engineering, including de novo library design in selection of favorable germline V gene scaffolds and CDR lengths. In addition, we have also developed a web application framework to present our knowledge database, and the web interface can help people to easily retrieve a variety of information from the knowledge database.},

The implication is that the entropy cost of binding is reduced and that this rigidification occurs as a consequence of somatic mutations during maturation. However, how these mutations modulate CDR flexibility is unclear. Here, molecular dynamics simulations captured CDR flexibility differences between four mature antibodies (7G12, AZ28, 28B4, and 48G7) and their germline predecessors. Analysis of their trajectories: (1) rationalized how mutations during affinity maturation restrict CDR motility, (2) captured the equilibrium between bound and unbound conformations for the H3 loop of unliganded 7G12, and (3) predicted a set of new mutations that, according to our simulations, should diminish binding by increasing flexibility.},

AXES results are found to be more discriminating than standard Crysol fitting of SAXS data when evaluating poorly or incorrectly modeled protein structures.

abstract = {Understanding antigen-antibody interactions at the sub-molecular level is of particular interest for scientific, regulatory, and intellectual property reasons, especially with increasing demand for monoclonal antibody therapeutic agents. Although various techniques are available for the determination of an epitope, there is no widely applicable, high-resolution, and reliable method available. Here, a combination approach using amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with proteolysis and mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and computational docking was applied to investigate antigen-antibody interactions. HDX-MS is a widely applicable, medium-resolution, medium-throughput technology that can be applied to epitope identification. First, the epitopes of cytochrome c-E8, IL-13-CNTO607, and IL-17A-CAT-2200 interactions identified using the HDX-MS method were compared with those identified by X-ray co-crystal structures. The identified epitopes are in good agreement with those identified using high-resolution X-ray crystallography. Second, the HDX-MS data were used as constraints for computational docking. More specifically, the non-epitope residues of an antigen identified using HDX-MS were designated as binding ineligible during computational docking. This approach, termed HDX-DOCK, gave more tightly clustered docking poses than stand-alone docking for all antigen-antibody interactions examined and improved docking results significantly for the cytochrome c-E8 interaction.},

abstract = {The humoral immune system in higher vertebrates is unique in its ability to generate highly diverse antibody responses against most pathogens as well as against certain malignancies. Several technologies have been developed to exploit this vast source of potentially therapeutic antibodies, including hybridoma technology, phage display and yeast display. Here, we present a novel, high-throughput technology (the Symplex Technology) for rapid direct cloning and identification of human antigen-specific high-affinity antibodies from single antibody-producing cells of immune individuals. The utility of the technology was demonstrated by isolation of diverse sets of unique high-affinity antibodies against tetanus toxoid and influenza virus from immunized volunteers. Hence, the Symplex Technology is a new method for the rapid isolation of high-affinity antibodies directly from humans.},

abstract = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV are believed to be a critical component of the protective responses elicited by an effective HIV vaccine. Neutralizing antibodies against the evolutionarily conserved CD4-binding site (CD4-BS) on the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) are capable of inhibiting infection of diverse HIV strains, and have been isolated from HIV-infected individuals. Despite the presence of anti-CD4-BS broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) epitopes on recombinant Env, Env immunization has so far failed to elicit such antibodies. Here, we show that Env immunogens fail to engage the germline-reverted forms of known bnAbs that target the CD4-BS. However, we found that the elimination of a conserved glycosylation site located in Loop D and two glycosylation sites located in variable region 5 of Env allows Env-binding to, and activation of, B cells expressing the germline-reverted BCRs of two potent broadly neutralizing antibodies, VRC01 and NIH45-46. Our results offer a possible explanation as to why Env immunogens have been ineffective in stimulating the production of such bNAbs. Importantly, they provide key information as to how such immunogens can be engineered to initiate the process of antibody-affinity maturation against one of the most conserved Env regions.},

abstract = {The role of affinity in determining neutralizing potency of mAbs directed against viruses is not well understood. We investigated the kinetic, structural, and functional advantage conferred by individual naturally occurring somatic mutations in the Ab H chain V region of Fab19, a well-described neutralizing human mAb directed to respiratory syncytial virus. Comparison of the affinity-matured Ab Fab19 with recombinant Fab19 Abs that were variants containing reverted amino acids from the inferred unmutated ancestor sequence revealed the molecular basis for affinity maturation of this Ab. Enhanced binding was achieved through mutations in the third H chain CDR (HCDR3) that conferred a markedly faster on-rate and a desirable increase in antiviral neutralizing activity. In contrast, most somatic mutations in the HCDR1 and HCDR2 regions did not significantly enhance Ag binding or antiviral activity. We observed a direct relationship between the measured association rate (Kon) for F protein and antiviral activity. Modeling studies of the structure of the Ag-Ab complex suggested the HCDR3 loop interacts with the antigenic site A surface loop of the respiratory syncytial virus F protein, previously shown to contain the epitope for this Ab by experimentation. These studies define a direct relationship of affinity and neutralizing activity for a viral glycoprotein-specific human mAb.},

Potent VRC01-class bNAbs against the CD4 binding site of HIV gp120 have been isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals; however, such bNAbs have not been induced by vaccination. Wild-type gp120 proteins lack detectable affinity for predicted germline precursors of VRC01-class bNAbs, making them poor immunogens to prime a VRC01-class response. We employed computation-guided, in vitro screening to engineer a germline-targeting gp120 outer domain immunogen that binds to multiple VRC01-class bNAbs and germline precursors and elucidated germline-binding crystallographically. When multimerized on nanoparticles, this immunogen (eOD-GT6) activates germline and mature VRC01-class B cells. Thus, eOD-GT6 nanoparticles have promise as a vaccine prime. In principle, germline-targeting strategies could be applied to other epitopes and pathogens.},

abstract = {Challenge studies following passive immunization with neutralizing Abs suggest that an HIV vaccine could be efficacious were it able to elicit broadly neutralizing Abs (bNAbs). To better understand the requirements for activation of B cells producing bNAbs, we generated cell lines expressing bNAbs or their germline-reverted versions (gl-bNAbs) as BCRs. We then tested the abilities of the bNAb-expressing cells to recognize HIV pseudovirions and vaccine candidate proteins by binding and activation assays. The results suggest that HIV envelope (Env) Ag-expressing, infection-competent virions are poorly recognized by high-affinity bNAb-expressing cells, as measured by the inability of Ags to induce rapid increases in intracellular calcium levels. Other Ag forms appear to be highly stimulatory, in particular, soluble gp140 trimers and a multimerized, scaffolded epitope protein. Virions failed to efficiently activate bNAb-expressing B cells owing to delayed or inefficient BCR recognition, most likely caused by the low density of Env spikes. Importantly, B cells carrying gl-bNAb BCRs were not stimulated by any of the tested vaccine candidates. These data provide insight into why many HIV immunogens, as well as natural HIV infections, fail to rapidly stimulate bNAb responses and suggest that bNAb-expressing cell lines might be useful tools in evaluation of vaccine Ags for infectious diseases. Because soluble Env trimers or multimerized scaffolded epitopes are best at activating B cell-expressing bNAbs, these antigenic forms should be considered as preferred vaccine components, although they should be modified to better target naive gl-bNAb B cells.},

A number of approaches are being pursued in the field, including building upon possible efficacy indicated by the recent RV144 clinical trial, which combined two HIV vaccines. Here, we argue for an approach based, in part, on understanding the HIV envelope spike and its interaction with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) at the molecular level and using this understanding to design immunogens as possible vaccines. BnAbs can protect against virus challenge in animal models, and many such antibodies have been isolated recently. We further propose that studies focused on how best to provide T cell help to B cells that produce bnAbs are crucial for optimal immunization strategies. The synthesis of rational immunogen design and immunization strategies, together with iterative improvements, offers great promise for advancing toward an HIV vaccine.},

abstract = {The RV144 trial demonstrated 31% vaccine efficacy at preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. Antibodies against the HIV-1 envelope variable loops 1 and 2 (Env V1 and V2) correlated inversely with infection risk. We proposed that vaccine-induced immune responses against V1/V2 would have a selective effect against, or sieve, HIV-1 breakthrough viruses. A total of 936 HIV-1 genome sequences from 44 vaccine and 66 placebo recipients were examined. We show that vaccine-induced immune responses were associated with two signatures in V2 at amino acid positions 169 and 181. Vaccine efficacy against viruses matching the vaccine at position 169 was 48% (confidence interval 18% to 66%; P = 0.0036), whereas vaccine efficacy against viruses mismatching the vaccine at position 181 was 78% (confidence interval 35% to 93%; P = 0.0028). Residue 169 is in a cationic glycosylated region recognized by broadly neutralizing and RV144-derived antibodies. The predicted distance between the two signature sites (21 $\pm$ 7 {\AA}) and their match/mismatch dichotomy indicate that multiple factors may be involved in the protection observed in RV144. Genetic signatures of RV144 vaccination in V2 complement the finding of an association between high V1/V2-binding antibodies and reduced risk of HIV-1 acquisition, and provide evidence that vaccine-induced V2 responses plausibly had a role in the partial protection conferred by the RV144 regimen.},

Adequate characterization of environmental and host-associated samples remains a challenge for microbiologists, despite the advent of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In order to increase the depth of sampling for diverse bacterial communities, we developed a method for sequencing and assembling millions of paired-end reads from the 16S rRNA gene (spanning the V3 region; ∼200 nucleotides) by using an Illumina genome analyzer. To confirm reproducibility and to identify a suitable computational pipeline for data analysis, sequence libraries were prepared in duplicate for both a defined mixture of DNAs from known cultured bacterial isolates (>1 million postassembly sequences) and an Arctic tundra soil sample (>6 million postassembly sequences). The Illumina 16S rRNA gene libraries represent a substantial increase in number of sequences over all extant next-generation sequencing approaches (e.g., 454 pyrosequencing), while the assembly of paired-end 125-base reads offers a methodological advantage by incorporating an initial quality control step for each 16S rRNA gene sequence. This method incorporates indexed primers to enable the characterization of multiple microbial communities in a single flow cell lane, may be modified readily to target other variable regions or genes, and demonstrates unprecedented and economical access to DNAs from organisms that exist at low relative abundances.},

METHODS:We followed the updated International Consultation on Urological Diseases evidence-based medicine recommendations to critically review the scientific evidence on male circumcision and HIV infection risk.

RESULTS:Level 1 evidence supports the concept that male circumcision substantially reduces the risk of HIV infection. Three major lines of evidence support this conclusion: biological data suggesting that this concept is plausible, data from observational studies supported by high-quality meta-analyses, and three randomized clinical trials supported by high-quality meta-analyses.

CONCLUSIONS:The evidence from these biological studies, observational studies, randomized controlled clinical trials, meta-analyses, and cost-effectiveness studies is conclusive. The challenges to implementation of male circumcision as a public health measure in high-risk populations must now be faced.},

abstract = {We analyzed 77 nonproductive and 574 productive human V(H)DJ(H) rearrangements with a newly developed program, JOINSOLVER. In the productive repertoire, the H chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3(H)) was significantly shorter (46.7 +/- 0.5 nucleotides) than in the nonproductive repertoire (53.8 +/- 1.9 nucleotides) because of the tendency to select rearrangements with less TdT activity and shorter D segments. Using criteria established by Monte Carlo simulations, D segments could be identified in 71.4% of nonproductive and 64.4% of productive rearrangements, with a mean of 17.6 +/- 0.7 and 14.6 +/- 0.2 retained germline nucleotides, respectively. Eight of 27 D segments were used more frequently than expected in the nonproductive repertoire, whereas 3 D segments were positively selected and 3 were negatively selected, indicating that both molecular mechanisms and selection biased the D segment usage. There was no bias for D segment reading frame (RF) use in the nonproductive repertoire, whereas negative selection of the RFs encoding stop codons and positive selection of RF2 that frequently encodes hydrophilic amino acids were noted in the productive repertoire. Except for serine, there was no consistent selection or expression of hydrophilic amino acids. A bias toward the pairing of 5' D segments with 3' J(H) segments was observed in the nonproductive but not the productive repertoire, whereas V(H) usage was random. Rearrangements using inverted D segments, DIR family segments, chromosome 15 D segments and multiple D segments were found infrequently. Analysis of the human CDR3(H) with JOINSOLVER has provided comprehensive information on the influences that shape this important Ag binding region of V(H) chains.},

abstract = {b12, one of the few broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1, binds to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the gp120 subunit of HIV-1 Env. Two small fragments of HIV-1 gp120, b121a and b122a, which display about 70% of the b12 epitope and include solubility-enhancing mutations, were designed. Bacterially expressed b121a/b122a were partially folded and could bind b12 but not the CD4bs-directed non-neutralizing antibody b6. Sera from rabbits primed with b121a or b122a protein fragments and boosted with full-length gp120 showed broad neutralizing activity in a TZM-bl assay against a 16-virus panel that included nine Tier 2 and 3 viruses as well as in a five-virus panel previously designed to screen for broad neutralization. Using a mean IC50 cut-off of 50, sera from control rabbits immunized with gp120 alone neutralized only one virus of the 14 non-Tier 1 viruses tested (7%), whereas sera from b121a- and b122a-immunized rabbits neutralized seven (50%) and twelve (86%) viruses, respectively. Serum depletion studies confirmed that neutralization was gp120-directed and that sera from animals immunized with gp120 contained lower amounts of CD4bs-directed antibodies than corresponding sera from animals immunized with b121a/b122a. Competition binding assays with b12 also showed that b121a/2a sera contained significantly higher amounts of antibodies directed toward the CD4 binding site than the gp120 sera. The data demonstrate that it is possible to elicit broadly neutralizing sera against HIV-1 in small animals.},

abstract = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies are considered an important part of a successful HIV vaccine. A better understanding of the factors underlying their development during infection and of the epitopes they target is needed to elicit similar antibody responses by vaccination. We and others reported that, on average, it takes 2 to 3 years for cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to become detectable in the sera of HIV-1-infected subjects and that they target a limited number of epitopes on the HIV Envelope. Here we investigated the emergence and evolution of the earliest cross-reactive neutralizing antibody specificities in one HIV-1-infected individual, AC053. We defined two distinct epitopes on Env that are targeted by the broadly neutralizing antibody responses developed by AC053. The first specificity became evident at 3 years post infection and targeted the CD4-binding site of Env. Antibodies responsible for that specificity neutralized most, but not all, viruses susceptible to neutralization by the plasma antibodies of AC053. The second specificity became apparent approximately a year later. It was due to PG9-like antibodies, which were able to neutralize those viruses not susceptible to the anti-CD4-BS antibodies in AC053. These findings improve our understanding of the co-development of broadly neutralizing antibodies that target more than one epitope during natural HIV-1-infection in selected HIV+ subjects. They support the hypothesis that developing broadly neutralizing antibody responses targeting distinct epitopes by immunization could be feasible.},

abstract = {Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) catalyzes the addition of nucleotides at the junctions of rearranging Ig and T cell receptor gene segments, thereby generating antigen receptor diversity. Ku is a heterodimeric protein composed of 70- and 86-kDa subunits that binds DNA ends and is required for V(D)J recombination and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. We provide evidence for a direct interaction between TdT and Ku proteins. Studies with a baculovirus expression system show that TdT can interact specifically with each of the Ku subunits and with the heterodimer. The interaction between Ku and TdT is also observed in pre-T cells with endogenously expressed proteins. The protein-protein interaction is DNA independent and occurs at physiological salt concentrations. Deletion mutagenesis experiments reveal that the N-terminal region of TdT (131 amino acids) is essential for interaction with the Ku heterodimer. This region, although not important for TdT polymerization activity, contains a BRCA1 C-terminal domain that has been shown to mediate interactions of proteins involved in DNA repair. The induction of DSBs in Cos-7 cells transfected with a human TdT expression construct resulted in the appearance of discrete nuclear foci in which TdT and Ku colocalize. The physical association of TdT with Ku suggests a possible mechanism by which TdT is recruited to the sites of DSBs such as V(D)J recombination intermediates.},

A critical next step in the reaction is opening of the hairpins, but the factor(s) responsible has not been identified and had been thought to be a ubiquitous component(s) of the DNA repair machinery. Here we demonstrate that RAG1 and RAG2 possess an intrinsic single-stranded nuclease activity capable of nicking hairpin coding ends at or near the hairpin tip. In Mn2+, a synthetic hairpin is nicked 5 nucleotides (nt) 5' of the hairpin tip, with more distant sites of nicking suppressed by HMG2. In Mg2+, hairpins generated by V(D)J cleavage are nicked whereas synthetic hairpins are not. Cleavage-generated hairpins are nicked at the tip and predominantly 1 to 2 nt 5' of the tip. RAG1 and RAG2 may therefore be responsible for initiating the processing of coding ends and for the generation of P nucleotides during V(D)J recombination.},

While PNP plays significant roles in human and pathogen physiology, we are interested in developing PNP as a catalyst for the formation of nucleoside analog drugs of clinical relevance. Towards this aim, we describe the engineering of human PNP to accept 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI, Videx((R))) as a substrate for phosphorolysis using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. In human PNP, we identified a single amino acid, Tyr-88, as a likely modulator of ribose selectivity. RosettaLigand was employed to calculate binding energies for substrate and substrate analog transition state complexes for single mutants of PNP where Tyr-88 was replaced with another amino acid. In parallel, these mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed and purified. A tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant (Y88F) was predicted by Rosetta to improve PNP catalytic activity with respect to ddI. Kinetic characterization of this mutant determined a 9-fold improvement in k(cat) and greater than 2-fold reduction in K(M). Subsequently, we used directed evolution to select for improved variants of PNP-Y88F in Escherichia coli cell extracts resulting in an additional 3-fold improvement over the progenitor strain. The engineered PNP may form the basis for catalysts and pathways for the biosynthesis of ddI.},

Here we describe a new approach to refining protein structure models that focuses sampling in regions most likely to contain errors while allowing the whole structure to relax in a physically realistic all-atom force field. In applications to models produced using nuclear magnetic resonance data and to comparative models based on distant structural homologues, the method can significantly improve the accuracy of the structures in terms of both the backbone conformations and the placement of core side chains. Furthermore, the resulting models satisfy a particularly stringent test: they provide significantly better solutions to the X-ray crystallographic phase problem in molecular replacement trials. Finally, we show that all-atom refinement can produce de novo protein structure predictions that reach the high accuracy required for molecular replacement without any experimental phase information and in the absence of templates suitable for molecular replacement from the Protein Data Bank. These results suggest that the combination of high-resolution structure prediction with state-of-the-art phasing tools may be unexpectedly powerful in phasing crystallographic data for which molecular replacement is hindered by the absence of sufficiently accurate previous models.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The native envelope gp160 trimer of HIV-1 is thought to shield vulnerable epitopes that could otherwise elicit effectively neutralizing antibodies. However, little is known about the prevalence of naturally occurring broadly neutralizing activity in serum of HIV-1-infected individuals.

METHODS:Here, we studied 35 participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV-1 infection (20 long-term nonprogressors and 15 progressors) for the presence of cross-reactive neutralizing activity in their sera at 2 and 4 years after seroconversion. Neutralizing activity was tested in a pseudovirus assay, against a panel of HIV-1 envelope variants from subtypes A, B, C, and D.

RESULTS:Already at year 2 after seroconversion, seven out of 35 individuals (20%) had cross-reactive neutralizing activity, which increased to 11 individuals (31%) at 4 years after seroconversion. There was no difference in the prevalence of cross-reactive neutralizing serum activity between long-term nonprogressors and progressors.Interestingly, high plasma viral RNA load and low CD4(+) cell count at set-point were associated with early development of cross-reactive neutralizing activity. Neutralization titers in serum increased during the course of infection for 91% of individuals studied here, although less rapidly for those who did not develop cross-reactive neutralizing activity.

CONCLUSION:Overall, we here demonstrate a relatively high prevalence of cross-reactive neutralizing serum activity in HIV-1-infected patients, which increased with duration of infection. These data may imply that immunogenicity of the native envelope spike of HIV-1 for eliciting cross-reactive humoral immune responses may be better than previously anticipated.},

abstract = {Most antibodies that broadly neutralize HIV-1 are highly somatically mutated in antibody clonal lineages that persist over time. Here, we describe the analysis of human antibodies induced during an HIV-1 vaccine trial (GSK PRO HIV-002) that used the clade B envelope (Env) gp120 of clone W6.1D (gp120(W6.1D)). Using dual-color antigen-specific sorting, we isolated Env-specific human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and studied the clonal persistence of antibodies in the setting of HIV-1 Env vaccination. We found evidence of V(H) somatic mutation induced by the vaccine but only to a modest level (3.8% $\pm$ 0.5%; range 0 to 8.2%). Analysis of 34 HIV-1-reactive MAbs recovered over four immunizations revealed evidence of both sequential recruitment of na{\"\i}ve B cells and restimulation of previously recruited memory B cells. These recombinant antibodies recapitulated the anti-HIV-1 activity of participant serum including pseudovirus neutralization and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). One antibody (3491) demonstrated a change in specificity following somatic mutation with binding of the inferred unmutated ancestor to a linear C2 peptide while the mutated antibody reacted only with a conformational epitope in gp120 Env. Thus, gp120(W6.1D) was strongly immunogenic but over four immunizations induced levels of affinity maturation below that of broadly neutralizing MAbs. Improved vaccination strategies will be needed to drive persistent stimulation of antibody clonal lineages to induce affinity maturation that results in highly mutated HIV-1 Env-reactive antibodies.},

abstract = {Current human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) vaccines elicit strain-specific neutralizing antibodies. However, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies arise in approximately 20% of HIV-1-infected individuals, and details of their generation could provide a blueprint for effective vaccination. Here we report the isolation, evolution and structure of a broadly neutralizing antibody from an African donor followed from the time of infection. The mature antibody, CH103, neutralized approximately 55% of HIV-1 isolates, and its co-crystal structure with the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 revealed a new loop-based mechanism of CD4-binding-site recognition. Virus and antibody gene sequencing revealed concomitant virus evolution and antibody maturation. Notably, the unmutated common ancestor of the CH103 lineage avidly bound the transmitted/founder HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, and evolution of antibody neutralization breadth was preceded by extensive viral diversification in and near the CH103 epitope. These data determine the viral and antibody evolution leading to induction of a lineage of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies, and provide insights into strategies to elicit similar antibodies by vaccination.},

We use this approach to optimize two computationally designed inhibitors against H1N1 influenza hemagglutinin and, in both cases, obtain variants with subnanomolar binding affinity. The most potent of these, a 51-residue protein, is broadly cross-reactive against all influenza group 1 hemagglutinins, including human H2, and neutralizes H1N1 viruses with a potency that rivals that of several human monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating that computational design followed by comprehensive energy landscape mapping can generate proteins with potential therapeutic utility.},

Here we challenge this view and suggest that many antibodies do not have a single conformation at the combining site. The basis for this proposal comes from the kinetic analysis of a set of murine hybridomas derived from defined stages of the immune response to 2-phenyl-5-oxazolone (Ox). Among them we have identified three antibodies that exhibit complex hapten-binding kinetics. We observed biphasic or triphasic reactions in stopped-flow fluorescence experiments, indicating that ligand binding involved isomerization, as well as associative steps. The existence of an equilibrium between at least two antibody conformations, with ligands binding preferentially to one form, was deduced from the variation with hapten concentration of the apparent rate of each phase.},

Ku70 and Ku80 share a common topology and form a dyad-symmetrical molecule with a preformed ring that encircles duplex DNA. The binding site can cradle two full turns of DNA while encircling only the central 3-4 base pairs (bp). Ku makes no contacts with DNA bases and few with the sugar-phosphate backbone, but it fits sterically to major and minor groove contours so as to position the DNA helix in a defined path through the protein ring. These features seem well designed to structurally support broken DNA ends and to bring the DNA helix into phase across the junction during end processing and ligation.},

We compared the physicochemical properties of antigen binding of several independent antibody panels derived from both germline and secondary responses. We found that antibody maturation essentially reflects modulations in entropy-control of the association, but not dissociation, step of the binding. This influence stems from variations in conformational heterogeneity of the antigen-combining site, which in turn regulates both the affinity and specificity for antigen. Thus, the simple device of manipulating conformational flexibility of paratope provides a mechanism wherein the transition from a degenerate recognition capability to a high-fidelity effector response is readily achieved, with the minimum of somatic mutations.},

For this purpose, sera from five individuals with CrNA and one elite neutralizer that were obtained at three monthly intervals in the first year after seroconversion and at multiple intervals over the disease course were tested for neutralizing activity against an established multiclade panel of six viruses. The same serum samples, as well as sera from three individuals who lacked CrNA, were tested for their neutralizing activities against autologous clonal HIV-1 variants from multiple time points covering the disease course from seroconversion onward. The elite neutralizer already had CrNA at 9.8 months postseroconversion, in contrast with the findings for the other five patients, in whom CrNA was first detected at 20 to 35 months postseroconversion and peaked around 35 months postseroconversion. In all patients, CrNA coincided with neutralizing activity against autologous viruses that were isolated <12 months postseroconversion, while viruses from later time points had already escaped autologous neutralizing activity. Also, the peak in gp160 sequence diversity coincided with the peak of CrNA titers. Individuals who lacked CrNA had lower peak autologous neutralizing titers, viral escape, and sequence diversity than individuals with CrNA. A better understanding of the underlying factors that determine the presence of CrNA or even an elite neutralizer phenotype may aid in the design of an HIV-1 vaccine.},

The widely held view has been that the great variability of viral glycoproteins would be an absolute obstacle to the development of antibody-based therapies or vaccines that could confer broad and long-lasting protection. In the past five years, new approaches have been developed to interrogate human memory B cells and plasma cells with high efficiency and to isolate several broadly neutralizing antiviral antibodies against highly variable pathogens such as HIV-1 and influenza virus. These antibodies not only provide new tools for prophylaxis and therapy for viral diseases but also identify conserved epitopes that may be used to design new vaccines capable of conferring broader protection.},

abstract = {Human antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) can neutralize a broad range of viral isolates in vitro and protect non-human primates against infection. Previous work showed that antibodies exert selective pressure on the virus but escape variants emerge within a short period of time. However, these experiments were performed before the recent discovery of more potent anti-HIV-1 antibodies and their improvement by structure-based design. Here we re-examine passive antibody transfer as a therapeutic modality in HIV-1-infected humanized mice. Although HIV-1 can escape from antibody monotherapy, combinations of broadly neutralizing antibodies can effectively control HIV-1 infection and suppress viral load to levels below detection. Moreover, in contrast to antiretroviral therapy, the longer half-life of antibodies led to control of viraemia for an average of 60 days after cessation of therapy. Thus, combinations of potent monoclonal antibodies can effectively control HIV-1 replication in humanized mice, and should be re-examined as a therapeutic modality in HIV-1-infected individuals.},

However, past strategies for vaccine development are unlikely to succeed in the future against major global diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. For such diseases, the correlates of protection are poorly defined and the pathogens evade immune detection and/or exhibit extensive genetic variability. Recent advances have heralded in a new era of vaccine discovery. However, translation of these advances into vaccines remains impeded by lack of understanding of key vaccinology principles in humans. We review these advances toward vaccine discovery and suggest that for accelerating successful vaccine development, new human immunology-based clinical research initiatives be implemented with the goal of elucidating and more effectively generating vaccine-induced protective immune responses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In the RV144 trial, the estimated efficacy of a vaccine regimen against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was 31.2%. We performed a case-control analysis to identify antibody and cellular immune correlates of infection risk.

METHODS:In pilot studies conducted with RV144 blood samples, 17 antibody or cellular assays met prespecified criteria, of which 6 were chosen for primary analysis to determine the roles of T-cell, IgG antibody, and IgA antibody responses in the modulation of infection risk. Assays were performed on samples from 41 vaccinees who became infected and 205 uninfected vaccinees, obtained 2 weeks after final immunization, to evaluate whether immune-response variables predicted HIV-1 infection through 42 months of follow-up.

RESULTS:Of six primary variables, two correlated significantly with infection risk: the binding of IgG antibodies to variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2) of HIV-1 envelope proteins (Env) correlated inversely with the rate of HIV-1 infection (estimated odds ratio, 0.57 per 1-SD increase; P=0.02; q=0.08), and the binding of plasma IgA antibodies to Env correlated directly with the rate of infection (estimated odds ratio, 1.54 per 1-SD increase; P=0.03; q=0.08). Neither low levels of V1V2 antibodies nor high levels of Env-specific IgA antibodies were associated with higher rates of infection than were found in the placebo group. Secondary analyses suggested that Env-specific IgA antibodies may mitigate the effects of potentially protective antibodies.

CONCLUSIONS:This immune-correlates study generated the hypotheses that V1V2 antibodies may have contributed to protection against HIV-1 infection, whereas high levels of Env-specific IgA antibodies may have mitigated the effects of protective antibodies. Vaccines that are designed to induce higher levels of V1V2 antibodies and lower levels of Env-specific IgA antibodies than are induced by the RV144 vaccine may have improved efficacy against HIV-1 infection.},

abstract = {HIV-1 uses a diverse N-linked-glycan shield to evade recognition by antibody. Select human antibodies, such as the clonally related PG9 and PG16, recognize glycopeptide epitopes in the HIV-1 V1-V2 region and penetrate this shield, but their ability to accommodate diverse glycans is unclear. Here we report the structure of antibody PG16 bound to a scaffolded V1-V2, showing an epitope comprising both high mannose-type and complex-type N-linked glycans. We combined structure, NMR and mutagenesis analyses to characterize glycan recognition by PG9 and PG16. Three PG16-specific residues, arginine, serine and histidine (RSH), were critical for binding sialic acid on complex-type glycans, and introduction of these residues into PG9 produced a chimeric antibody with enhanced HIV-1 neutralization. Although HIV-1-glycan diversity facilitates evasion, antibody somatic diversity can overcome this and can provide clues to guide the design of modified antibodies with enhanced neutralization.},

Here we present a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm, implemented within Rosetta, to predict the structure of proteins in which one domain is inserted into another. Three MC moves combine rigid-body and loop movements to search the constrained conformation by structure disruption and subsequent repair of chain breaks. Local searches find that the algorithm samples and recovers near-native structures consistently. Further global searches produced top-ranked structures within 5 A in 31 of 50 cases in low-resolution mode, and refinement of top-ranked low-resolution structures produced models within 2 A in 21 of 50 cases. Rigid-body orientations were often correctly recovered despite errors in linker conformation. The algorithm is broadly applicable to de novo structure prediction of both naturally occurring and engineered domain insertion proteins.},

With the determination of the first crystal structures, interest in structure-based ligand discovery increased. Unfortunately, for most GPCRs no experimental structures are available. The determination of the D(3) receptor structure and the challenge to the community to predict it enabled a fully prospective comparison of ligand discovery from a modeled structure versus that of the subsequently released crystal structure. Over 3.3 million molecules were docked against a homology model, and 26 of the highest ranking were tested for binding. Six had affinities ranging from 0.2 to 3.1 $\mu$M. Subsequently, the crystal structure was released and the docking screen repeated. Of the 25 compounds selected, five had affinities ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 $\mu$M. One of the new ligands from the homology model screen was optimized for affinity to 81 nM. The feasibility of docking screens against modeled GPCRs more generally is considered.},

Despite that pleasing logic the results have been somewhat mixed. Here we describe a virtual screening technique based on ligand-receptor shape complementarity, Ultrafast Shape Recognition (USR). USR is specifically applied to identify novel inhibitors of arylamine N-acetyltransferases by computationally screening almost 700 million molecular conformers in a time- and resource-efficient manner. A small number of the predicted active compounds were purchased and tested obtaining a confirmed hit rate of 40 per cent which is an outstanding result for a prospective virtual screening.},

The trie structure avoids redundant energy computations, and lends itself to timesaving pruning techniques based on a simple geometric criteria. With our new algorithm, we compute rotamer-pair energies nearly 4 times faster than the previous approach.},

abstract = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to HIV-1 can prevent infection and are therefore of great importance for HIV-1 vaccine design. Notably, bNAbs are highly somatically mutated and generated by a fraction of HIV-1-infected individuals several years after infection. Antibodies typically accumulate mutations in the complementarity determining region (CDR) loops, which usually contact the antigen. The CDR loops are scaffolded by canonical framework regions (FWRs) that are both resistant to and less tolerant of mutations. Here, we report that in contrast to most antibodies, including those with limited HIV-1 neutralizing activity, most bNAbs require somatic mutations in their FWRs. Structural and functional analyses reveal that somatic mutations in FWR residues enhance breadth and potency by providing increased flexibility and/or direct antigen contact. Thus, in bNAbs, FWRs play an essential role beyond scaffolding the CDR loops and their unusual contribution to potency and breadth should be considered in HIV-1 vaccine design.},

abstract = {We present a Bayesian statistical analysis of the conformations of side chains in proteins from the Protein Data Bank. This is an extension of the backbone-dependent rotamer library, and includes rotamer populations and average chi angles for a full range of phi, psi values. The Bayesian analysis used here provides a rigorous statistical method for taking account of varying amounts of data. Bayesian statistics requires the assumption of a prior distribution for parameters over their range of possible values. This prior distribution can be derived from previous data or from pooling some of the present data. The prior distribution is combined with the data to form the posterior distribution, which is a compromise between the prior distribution and the data. For the chi 2, chi 3, and chi 4 rotamer prior distributions, we assume that the probability of each rotamer type is dependent only on the previous chi rotamer in the chain. For the backbone-dependence of the chi 1 rotamers, we derive prior distributions from the product of the phi-dependent and psi-dependent probabilities. Molecular mechanics calculations with the CHARMM22 potential show a strong similarity with the experimental distributions, indicating that proteins attain their lowest energy rotamers with respect to local backbone-side-chain interactions. The new library is suitable for use in homology modeling, protein folding simulations, and the refinement of X-ray and NMR structures.},

abstract = {Germinal centers develop in follicles during TD antibody responses in the first 3 wk following each immunization. In primary responses to protein-based antigens, T-cell help is limiting, follicles develop towards the end of the 1st wk from immunization and the size of the follicular response in relatively small. When T-cell help is provided the primary B-cell response in follicles is much larger, B cells start to proliferate in follicles within a few hours of immunization and reach peak size 3-4 d later. Available evidence suggests that virgin B cells that colonize follicles to form germinal centers must first be activated by antigen outside follicles, probably in T zones. Memory B cells also proliferate in follicles and they can do so without first being activated outside follicles. Germinal center formation consists of an initial phase of exponential proliferation of B cells within the follicular dendritic cell network. After a single immunization the follicular response is oligoclonal and on average only 3 cells colonize each follicle. In responses to hapten-protein in rats primed previously with the carrier protein these 3 cells increase to around 10(4) cells in 3 d with a cell cycle time of about 6 h. At the end of the period of exponential growth of B blasts, the classical structure of germinal centers emerges. The B blasts become centroblasts in the dark zone of the germinal center which develops at that pole of the FDC network nearer the T zones. The centroblasts are still in rapid cell cycle but do not more than sustain their numbers. The rest of their progeny move to the heart of the FDC network where they come out of cell cycle as centrocytes. Evidence is cited which indicates that somatic mutation occurs in the Ig V-region genes of centroblasts and that centrocytes are selected on the basis of their ability to respond to antigen held on FDC. Centrocytes not receiving this antigen-dependent signal kill themselves by apoptosis. Centrocytes positively selected by interaction with antigen on FDC receive further signals which induce the cells to differentiate to become either plasma cells or memory B cells. The nature of some of these differentiation signals is described. It is shown that proliferation, selection and differentiation occur within germinal centers in distinct micro-environments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Ligands bound to structures similar to the query are superimposed onto the model and used to predict the binding site. In benchmarking against the CASP8 targets 3DLigandSite obtains a Matthew's correlation co-efficient (MCC) of 0.64, and coverage and accuracy of 71 and 60%, respectively, similar results to our manual performance in CASP8. In further benchmarking using a large set of protein structures, 3DLigandSite obtains an MCC of 0.68. The web server enables users to submit either a query sequence or structure.

abstract = {Somatic hypermutation (SHM) underlies the generation of a diverse repertoire of high-affinity antibodies. It is effected by a two-step process: (i) DNA lesions initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), and (ii) lesion repair by the combined intervention of DNA replication and repair factors that include mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases. AID and TLS polymerases that are crucial to SHM, namely polymerase (pol) theta, pol zeta and pol eta, are induced in B cells by the stimuli that are required to trigger this process: B-cell receptor crosslinking and CD40 engagement by CD154. These polymerases, together with MMR proteins and other DNA replication and repair factors, could assemble to form a multimolecular complex ("mutasome") at the site of DNA lesions. Molecular interactions in the mutasome would result in a "polymerase switch", that is, the substitution of the high-fidelity replicative pol delta and pol epsilon with the TLS pol theta, pol eta, Rev1, pol zeta and, perhaps, pol iota, which are error-prone and crucially insert mismatches or mutations while repairing DNA lesions. Here, we place these concepts in the context of the existing in vivo and in vitro findings, and discuss an integrated mechanistic model of SHM.},

Although efforts to elicit broadly cross-neutralizing (BCN) antibodies by vaccination have been unsuccessful, a minority of individuals naturally develop these antibodies after many years of infection. How such antibodies arise, and the role of viral evolution in shaping these responses, is unknown. Here we show, in two HIV-1-infected individuals who developed BCN antibodies targeting the glycan at Asn332 on the gp120 envelope, that this glycan was absent on the initial infecting virus. However, this BCN epitope evolved within 6 months, through immune escape from earlier strain-specific antibodies that resulted in a shift of a glycan to position 332. Both viruses that lacked the glycan at amino acid 332 were resistant to the Asn332-dependent BCN monoclonal antibody PGT128 (ref. 8), whereas escaped variants that acquired this glycan were sensitive. Analysis of large sequence and neutralization data sets showed the 332 glycan to be significantly under-represented in transmitted subtype C viruses compared to chronic viruses, with the absence of this glycan corresponding with resistance to PGT128. These findings highlight the dynamic interplay between early antibodies and viral escape in driving the evolution of conserved BCN antibody epitopes.},

abstract = {A protein's flexibility is well recognized to underlie its capacity to engage in critical functions, such as signal transduction, biomolecular transport and biochemical reactivity. Molecular recognition is also tightly linked to the dynamics of the binding partners, yet protein flexibility has largely been ignored by the growing field of structure-based drug design (SBDD). In combination with experimentally determined structures, a number of computational methods have been proposed to model protein movements, which may be important for small molecule binding. Such techniques have the ability to expose new binding site conformations, which may in turn recognize and lead to the discovery of more potent and selective drugs through molecular docking. In this article, we discuss various methods and focus on the Relaxed Complex Scheme (RCS), which uses Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to model full protein flexibility and enhance virtual screening programmes. We review practical applications of the RCS and use a recent study of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase to illustrate the various phases of the scheme. We also discuss some encouraging developments, aimed at addressing current weaknesses of the RCS.},

abstract = {Broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies are the focus of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 vaccine design. However, only little is known about their role in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pathogenesis and the factors associated with their development. Here we used a multisubtype panel of 23 HIV-1 variants to determine the prevalence of cross-reactive neutralizing activity in serum samples obtained approximately 35 months after seroconversion from 82 HIV-1 subtype B-infected participants from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV Infection and AIDS. Of these patients, 33%, 48%, and 20%, respectively, had strong, moderate, or absent cross-reactive neutralizing activity in serum. Viral RNA load at set point and AIDS-free survival were similar for the 3 patient groups. However, higher cross-reactive neutralizing activity was significantly associated with lower CD4(+) T cell counts before and soon after infection. Our findings underscore the importance of vaccine-elicited immunity in protecting from infection. The association between CD4(+) T cell counts and neutralizing humoral immunity may provide new clues as to how to achieve this goal.},

abstract = {Broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies (bNAbs) can recognize carbohydrate-dependent epitopes on gp120. In contrast to previously characterized glycan-dependent bNAbs that recognize high-mannose N-glycans, PGT121 binds complex-type N-glycans in glycan microarrays. We isolated the B-cell clone encoding PGT121, which segregates into PGT121-like and 10-1074-like groups distinguished by sequence, binding affinity, carbohydrate recognition, and neutralizing activity. Group 10-1074 exhibits remarkable potency and breadth but no detectable binding to protein-free glycans. Crystal structures of unliganded PGT121, 10-1074, and their likely germ-line precursor reveal that differential carbohydrate recognition maps to a cleft between complementarity determining region (CDR)H2 and CDRH3. This cleft was occupied by a complex-type N-glycan in a "liganded" PGT121 structure. Swapping glycan contact residues between PGT121 and 10-1074 confirmed their importance for neutralization. Although PGT121 binds complex-type N-glycans, PGT121 recognized high-mannose-only HIV envelopes in isolation and on virions. As HIV envelopes exhibit varying proportions of high-mannose- and complex-type N-glycans, these results suggest promiscuous carbohydrate interactions, an advantageous adaptation ensuring neutralization of all viruses within a given strain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The development of a safe and effective vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is critical to pandemic control.

METHODS:In a community-based, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial, we evaluated four priming injections of a recombinant canarypox vector vaccine (ALVAC-HIV [vCP1521]) plus two booster injections of a recombinant glycoprotein 120 subunit vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E). The vaccine and placebo injections were administered to 16,402 healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 30 years in Rayong and Chon Buri provinces in Thailand. The volunteers, primarily at heterosexual risk for HIV infection, were monitored for the coprimary end points: HIV-1 infection and early HIV-1 viremia, at the end of the 6-month vaccination series and every 6 months thereafter for 3 years.

RESULTS:In the intention-to-treat analysis involving 16,402 subjects, there was a trend toward the prevention of HIV-1 infection among the vaccine recipients, with a vaccine efficacy of 26.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.0 to 47.9; P=0.08). In the per-protocol analysis involving 12,542 subjects, the vaccine efficacy was 26.2% (95% CI, -13.3 to 51.9; P=0.16). In the modified intention-to-treat analysis involving 16,395 subjects (with the exclusion of 7 subjects who were found to have had HIV-1 infection at baseline), the vaccine efficacy was 31.2% (95% CI, 1.1 to 52.1; P=0.04). Vaccination did not affect the degree of viremia or the CD4+ T-cell count in subjects in whom HIV-1 infection was subsequently diagnosed.

CONCLUSIONS:This ALVAC-HIV and AIDSVAX B/E vaccine regimen may reduce the risk of HIV infection in a community-based population with largely heterosexual risk. Vaccination did not affect the viral load or CD4+ count in subjects with HIV infection. Although the results show only a modest benefit, they offer insight for future research.

abstract = {Structure-based drug design is frequently used to accelerate the development of small-molecule therapeutics. Although substantial progress has been made in X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the availability of high-resolution structures is limited owing to the frequent inability to crystallize or obtain sufficient NMR restraints for large or flexible proteins. Computational methods can be used to both predict unknown protein structures and model ligand interactions when experimental data are unavailable. This paper describes a comprehensive and detailed protocol using the Rosetta modeling suite to dock small-molecule ligands into comparative models. In the protocol presented here, we review the comparative modeling process, including sequence alignment, threading and loop building. Next, we cover docking a small-molecule ligand into the protein comparative model. In addition, we discuss criteria that can improve ligand docking into comparative models. Finally, and importantly, we present a strategy for assessing model quality. The entire protocol is presented on a single example selected solely for didactic purposes. The results are therefore not representative and do not replace benchmarks published elsewhere. We also provide an additional tutorial so that the user can gain hands-on experience in using Rosetta. The protocol should take 5-7 h, with additional time allocated for computer generation of models.},

In addition, conserved vulnerable regions on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein are often poorly immunogenic and elicit broadly neutralizing antibody responses (BNAbs) in a minority of HIV-1-infected individuals and only after several years of infection. All of the known BNAbs demonstrate high levels of somatic mutations and often display other unusual traits, such as a long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) and autoreactivity that can be limited by host tolerance controls. Nonetheless, the demonstration that HIV-1-infected individuals can make potent BNAbs is encouraging, and recent progress in isolating such antibodies and mapping their immune pathways of development is providing new strategies for vaccination.},

abstract = {PG9 is the founder member of an expanding family of glycan-dependent human antibodies that preferentially bind the HIV (HIV-1) envelope (Env) glycoprotein (gp) trimer and broadly neutralize the virus. Here, we show that a soluble SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer constructed from the Clade A BG505 sequence binds PG9 with high affinity (∼11 nM), enabling structural and biophysical characterizations of the PG9:Env trimer complex. The BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer is remarkably stable as assessed by electron microscopy (EM) and differential scanning calorimetry. EM, small angle X-ray scattering, size exclusion chromatography with inline multiangle light scattering and isothermal titration calorimetry all indicate that only a single PG9 fragment antigen-binding (Fab) binds to the Env trimer. An ∼18 {\AA} EM reconstruction demonstrates that PG9 recognizes the trimer asymmetrically at its apex via contact with two of the three gp120 protomers, possibly contributing to its reported preference for a quaternary epitope. Molecular modeling and isothermal titration calorimetry binding experiments with an engineered PG9 mutant suggest that, in addition to the N156 and N160 glycan interactions observed in crystal structures of PG9 with a scaffolded V1/V2 domain, PG9 makes secondary interactions with an N160 glycan from an adjacent gp120 protomer in the antibody-trimer complex. Together, these structural and biophysical findings should facilitate the design of HIV-1 immunogens that possess all elements of the quaternary PG9 epitope required to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies against this region.},

abstract = {Germinal centers develop in the B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues during T cell-dependent (TD) antibody responses. The B cells that give rise to germinal centers initially have to be activated outside follicles, in the T cell-rich zones in association with interdigitating cells and T cell help. After immunization with a single dose of protein-based antigen, the germinal centers formed are oligoclonal; on average three B blasts colonize each follicle. These blasts undergo massive clonal expansion and activate a site-directed hypermutation mechanism that acts on their immunoglobulin-variable (Ig-v)-region genes. Mature germinal centers are divided into dark and light zones. The proliferating blasts, centroblasts, occupy the dark zone and give rise to centrocytes that are not in cell cycle and fill the light zone. The light zone contains a rich network of follicular dendritic cells (FDC) that have the capacity to take up antigen and hold this on their surface for periods of more than a year. The antigen is held as an immune complex in a native unprocessed form; but the antigen may be taken up from FDC by B cells, which can process this and present it to T cells. Centrocytes appear to be selected by their ability to interact with antigen held on FDC. There is a high death rate among centrocytes in vivo, and when these cells are isolated in vitro, they undergo apoptosis within hours on culture. The onset of apoptosis can be delayed by cross-linking centrocytes' surface Ig, and long-term survival is achieved by signalling through their surface CD40. After activation through CD40 the centrocytes increase their surface Ig and acquire characteristics of memory and processing of antigen held on FDC and its presentation to T cells that can be induced to express CD40 ligand at the point of cognate interaction. Other signals that induce a proportion of germinal center cells to become plasma cells have also been described. Germinal centers persist for about 3 weeks following immunization, but after this, memory B blasts continue to proliferate in follicles throughout the months of T cell-dependent antibody responses. These cells are probably the source of plasma cells and memory cells required to maintain long-term antibody production and memory after the first 3 weeks of T cell-dependent antibody responses.},

abstract = {The trimeric envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) is the focus of vaccine development programs aimed at generating protective humoral responses to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). N-Linked glycans, which constitute almost half of the molecular mass of the external Env domains, produce considerable structural heterogeneity and are a major impediment to crystallization studies. Moreover, by shielding the peptide backbone, glycans can block attempts to generate neutralizing antibodies against a substantial subset of potential epitopes when Env proteins are used as immunogens. Here, we describe the partial deglycosylation of soluble, cleaved recombinant Env trimers by inhibition of the synthesis of complex N-glycans during Env production, followed by treatment with glycosidases under conditions that preserve Env trimer integrity. The partially deglycosylated trimers are stable, and neither abnormally sensitive to proteolytic digestion nor prone to aggregation. Moreover, the deglycosylated trimers retain or increase their ability to bind CD4 and antibodies that are directed to conformational epitopes, including the CD4-binding site and the V3 region. However, as expected, they do not react with glycan-dependent antibodies 2G12 and PGT123, or the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN. Electron microscopic analysis shows that partially deglycosylated trimers have a structure similar to fully glycosylated trimers, indicating that removal of glycans does not substantially perturb the structural integrity of the trimer. The glycan-depleted Env trimers should be useful for structural and immunogenicity studies.},

abstract = {The repertoire of antibody variable (V) regions has been subject to evolutionary selection, affecting both the diversity of V region genes in the germline and their expression in the B lymphocyte population and its subsets. In ontogeny, contact with an antigen leads to the expansion of B cells expressing antibodies complementary to it. In a defined phase of B cell differentiation, new sets of V regions are generated from the existing repertoire through somatic hypermutation. Cells carrying advantageous antibody mutants are selected into the memory compartment and produce a stable secondary response upon reexposure to the antigen.},

abstract = {Conformer generation has important implications in cheminformatics, particularly in computational drug discovery where the quality of conformer generation software may affect the outcome of a virtual screening exercise. We examine the performance of four freely available small molecule conformer generation tools (Balloon, Confab, Frog2, and RDKit) alongside a commercial tool (MOE). The aim of this study is 3-fold: (i) to identify which tools most accurately reproduce experimentally determined structures; (ii) to examine the diversity of the generated conformational set; and (iii) to benchmark the computational time expended. These aspects were tested using a set of 708 drug-like molecules assembled from the OMEGA validation set and the Astex Diverse Set. These molecules have varying physicochemical properties and at least one known X-ray crystal structure. We found that RDKit and Confab are statistically better than other methods at generating low rmsd conformers to the known structure. RDKit is particularly suited for less flexible molecules while Confab, with its systematic approach, is able to generate conformers which are geometrically closer to the experimentally determined structure for molecules with a large number of rotatable bonds (≥10). In our tests RDKit also resulted as the second fastest method after Frog2. In order to enhance the performance of RDKit, we developed a postprocessing algorithm to build a diverse and representative set of conformers which also contains a close conformer to the known structure. Our analysis indicates that, with postprocessing, RDKit is a valid free alternative to commercial, proprietary software.},

abstract = {A desirable but as yet unachieved property of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine candidate is the ability to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). One approach to the problem is to create trimeric mimics of the native envelope glycoprotein (Env) spike that expose as many bNAb epitopes as possible, while occluding those for non-neutralizing antibodies (non-NAbs). Here, we describe the design and properties of soluble, cleaved SOSIP.664 gp140 trimers based on the subtype A transmitted/founder strain, BG505. These trimers are highly stable, more so even than the corresponding gp120 monomer, as judged by differential scanning calorimetry. They are also homogenous and closely resemble native virus spikes when visualized by negative stain electron microscopy (EM). We used several techniques, including ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), to determine the relationship between the ability of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to bind the soluble trimers and neutralize the corresponding virus. In general, the concordance was excellent, in that virtually all bNAbs against multiple neutralizing epitopes on HIV-1 Env were highly reactive with the BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimers, including quaternary epitopes (CH01, PG9, PG16 and PGT145). Conversely, non-NAbs to the CD4-binding site, CD4-induced epitopes or gp41ECTO did not react with the trimers, even when their epitopes were present on simpler forms of Env (e.g. gp120 monomers or dissociated gp41 subunits). Three non-neutralizing MAbs to V3 epitopes did, however, react strongly with the trimers but only by ELISA, and not at all by SPR and to only a limited extent by EM. These new soluble trimers are useful for structural studies and are being assessed for their performance as immunogens.},

abstract = {Somatic hypermutation and clonal selection lead to B cells expressing high-affinity antibodies. Here we show that somatic mutations not only play a critical role in antigen binding, they also affect the thermodynamic stability of the antibody molecule. Somatic mutations directly involved in antigen recognition by antibody 93F3, which binds a relatively small hapten, reduce the melting temperature compared with its germ-line precursor by up to 9 $\,^{\circ}$C. The destabilizing effects of these mutations are compensated by additional somatic mutations located on surface loops distal to the antigen binding site. Similarly, somatic mutations enhance both the affinity and thermodynamic stability of antibody OKT3, which binds the large protein antigen CD3. Analysis of the crystal structures of 93F3 and OKT3 indicates that these somatic mutations modulate antibody stability primarily through the interface of the heavy and light chain variable domains. The historical view of antibody maturation has been that somatic hypermutation and subsequent clonal selection increase antigen-antibody specificity and binding energy. Our results suggest that this process also optimizes protein stability, and that many peripheral mutations that were considered to be neutral are required to offset deleterious effects of mutations that increase affinity. Thus, the immunological evolution of antibodies recapitulates on a much shorter timescale the natural evolution of enzymes in which function and thermodynamic stability are simultaneously enhanced through mutation and selection.},

We term this D-limited IgH allele DeltaD-DFL. Although the absolute number of IgM+IgD- B cells in the bone marrow was decreased, homozygous DeltaD-DFL BALB/c mice contained normal numbers of IgM+IgD+ B cells in bone marrow and spleen and normal numbers of B1a, B1b, and B2 cells in the peritoneal cavity. Bone marrow IgM+IgD+ B cells express a CDR-H3 repertoire similar in length and amino acid composition to the DFL16.1 subset of the wild-type BALB/c repertoire but divergent from sequences that do not contain DFL16.1. This similarity in content is the product of both germline bias and somatic selection, especially in the transition to the mature IgM+IgD+ stage of development. Serum Ig concentrations and the humoral immune response to a T-dependent Ag ([4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl]acetyl hapten) were nearly identical to wild-type littermate controls. A greater variance in the immune response to the T-independent Ag (alpha(1-->3)-dextran) was observed in DeltaD-DFL homozygotes, with half of the mice exhibiting levels below the range exhibited by controls. Although limited to a repertoire specific to DFL16.1, the presence of a single DH gene segment of normal sequence was sufficient for development of normal numbers of mature B cells and for robust humoral immune function.},

Antibody neutralization has been shown to be dependent on the presence of N-linked glycosylation at position 160 in gp120. We show here that (i) the loss of several key glycosylation sites in the V1, V2, and V3 loops; (ii) the generation of pseudoviruses in the presence of various glycosidase inhibitors; and (iii) the growth of pseudoviruses in a mutant cell line (GnT1(-/-)) that alters envelope glycosylation patterns all have significant effects on the sensitivity of virus to neutralization by PG9 and PG16. However, the interaction of antibody is not inhibited by sugar monosaccharides corresponding to those found in glycans on the HIV surface. We show that some of the glycosylation effects described are isolate dependent and others are universal and can be used as diagnostic for the presence of PG9 and PG16-like antibodies in the sera of HIV-1-infected patients. The results suggest that PG9 and PG16 recognize a conformational epitope that is dependent on glycosylation at specific variable loop N-linked sites. This information may be valuable for the design of immunogens to elicit PG9 and PG16-like antibodies, as well as constructs for cocrystallization studies.},

The impact of gp120-gp41 cleavage on trimer structure, in the presence or absence of trimer-stabilizing modifications (i.e., a gp120-gp41 disulfide bond and an I559P gp41 change, together designated SOSIP), was assessed. Without SOSIP changes, cleaved trimers disintegrate into their gp120 and gp41-ectodomain (gp41ECTO) components; when only the disulfide bond is present, they dissociate into gp140 monomers. Uncleaved gp140s remain trimeric whether SOSIP substitutions are present or not. However, negative-stain electron microscopy reveals that only cleaved trimers form homogeneous structures resembling native Env spikes on virus particles. In contrast, uncleaved trimers are highly heterogeneous, adopting a variety of irregular shapes, many of which appear to be gp120 subunits dangling from a central core that is presumably a trimeric form of gp41ECTO. Antigenicity studies with neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies are consistent with the EM images; cleaved, SOSIP-stabilized trimers express quaternary structure-dependent epitopes, whereas uncleaved trimers expose nonneutralizing gp120 and gp41ECTO epitopes that are occluded on cleaved trimers. These findings have adverse implications for using soluble, uncleaved trimers for structural studies, and the rationale for testing uncleaved trimers as vaccine candidates also needs to be reevaluated.},

abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry into host cells is mediated by the trimeric envelope glycoprotein complex (Env). Accordingly, the Env proteins are the targets for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and are the focus of vaccines intended to induce NAbs. Because the Env complex is labile, soluble recombinant Env (gp140) trimers require engineering to stabilize them sufficiently for use as immunogens. Trimeric forms of gp140 trimers can be created that are either cleavage-competent or cleavage-defective at the junction between the gp120 and gp41 subunits. As functional trimers are cleaved at this site, the question arises as to whether cleavage affects the antigenic structure of the Env complex in a way that is relevant to vaccine design. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the antigenicity profiles of cleaved and uncleaved gp140 trimers derived from the KNH1144 (subtype A) virus that are otherwise closely sequence-matched. While cleavage did not affect the exposure of NAb epitopes on the gp140 trimers, non-neutralizing antibodies to gp41 epitopes bound much more strongly to uncleaved trimers. Hence cleavage does alter the structure of the HIV-1 Env complex.},

abstract = {The discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has provided an enormous impetus to the HIV vaccine research and to entire immunology. The bNAber database at http://bNAber.org provides open, user-friendly access to detailed data on the rapidly growing list of HIV bNAbs, including neutralization profiles, sequences and three-dimensional structures (when available). It also provides an extensive list of visualization and analysis tools, such as heatmaps to analyse neutralization data as well as structure and sequence viewers to correlate bNAbs properties with structural and sequence features of individual antibodies. The goal of the bNAber database is to enable researchers in this field to easily compare and analyse available information on bNAbs thereby supporting efforts to design an effective vaccine for HIV/AIDS. The bNAber database not only provides easy access to data that currently is scattered in the Supplementary Materials sections of individual papers, but also contributes to the development of general standards of data that have to be presented with the discovery of new bNAbs and a universal mechanism of how such data can be shared.},

abstract = {The structure of the Fab' fragment of a human myeloma immunoglobulin was determined by x-ray crystallographic analysis at 2.8-A resolution. The Fourier map of the electron density was correlated with the aminoacid sequence to obtain a three-dimensional model. Four globular subunits, which correspond to the homology regions of the light and heavy chains, are arranged in a tetrahedral configuration. These subunits closely resemble each other, sharing a basic pattern of polypeptide chain folding. In each subunit, long sequences of tightly packed, hydrogen bonded polypeptide chain run parallel to the major axis of the subunit. No helical conformation can be seen. Different patterns of interchain disulfide linkage and unusual intrachain disulfide bonds that have been observed in other immunoglobulins can be explained with this model. The regions of hypervariable sequences in the light and heavy chains occur at one end of the molecule, in close spatial proximity.},

The essential architecture of the CDR-H3 repertoire observed in the mature B cell fraction F was already established in the early pre-B cell fraction C. These architectural features include V(H) gene segment use preference, D(H) family usage, J(H) rank order, predicted structures of the CDR-H3 base and loop, and the amino acid composition and average hydrophobicity of the CDR-H3 loop. With development, the repertoire was focused by eliminating outliers to what appears to be a preferred repertoire in terms of length, amino acid composition, and average hydrophobicity. Unlike humans, the average length of CDR-H3 increased during development. The majority of this increase came from enhanced preservation of J(H) sequence. This was associated with an increase in the prevalence of tyrosine. With an accompanying increase in glycine, a shift in hydrophobicity was observed in the CDR-H3 loop from near neutral in fraction C (-0.08 +/- 0.03) to mild hydrophilic in fraction F (-0.17 +/- 0.02). Fundamental constraints on the sequence and structure of CDR-H3 are thus established before surface IgM expression.},

SOSIP gp140 derived from a subtype A HIV-1 isolate, KNH1144, forms exceptionally stable trimers that resemble virion-associated Env in antigenicity and topology. Here, we used electron microscopy to demonstrate that KNH1144 SOSIP gp140 trimers bound three soluble CD4 molecules in a symmetrical orientation similar to that seen for native Env. We compared the immunogenicities of KNH1144 SOSIP gp140 trimers and gp120 monomers in rabbits and found that the trimers were superior at eliciting neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to homologous virus as well as neutralization-sensitive subtype B and C viruses. The NAb specificities for SOSIP antisera mapped in part to the CD4 binding site on gp120. We also observed adjuvant-dependent induction of antibodies to the residual levels of host cell proteins (HCPs) contained in the purified Env preparations. When present, HCP antibodies enhanced pseudovirus infection. Our findings are relevant for the further development of Env-based vaccines for HIV-1.},

abstract = {The initial step in HIV-1 infection occurs with the binding of cell surface CD4 to trimeric HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env), a heterodimer of a transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) and a surface glycoprotein (gp120). The design of soluble versions of trimeric Env that display structural and functional properties similar to those observed on intact viruses is highly desirable from the viewpoint of designing immunogens that could be effective as vaccines against HIV/AIDS. Using cryoelectron tomography combined with subvolume averaging, we have analyzed the structure of SOSIP gp140 trimers, which are cleaved, solubilized versions of the ectodomain of trimeric HIV-1 Env. We show that unliganded gp140 trimers adopt a quaternary arrangement similar to that displayed by native unliganded trimers on the surface of intact HIV-1 virions. When complexed with soluble CD4, Fab 17b, which binds to gp120 at its chemokine coreceptor binding site, or both soluble CD4 and 17b Fab, gp140 trimers display an open conformation in which there is an outward rotation and displacement of each gp120 protomer. We demonstrate that the molecular arrangements of gp120 trimers in the closed and open conformations of the soluble trimer are the same as those observed for the closed and open states, respectively, of trimeric gp120 on intact HIV-1 BaL virions, establishing that soluble gp140 trimers can be designed to mimic the quaternary structural transitions displayed by native trimeric Env.},

To understand how such broadly neutralizing antibodies develop, we used x-ray crystallography and 454 pyrosequencing to characterize additional VRC01-like antibodies from HIV-1-infected individuals. Crystal structures revealed a convergent mode of binding for diverse antibodies to the same CD4-binding-site epitope. A functional genomics analysis of expressed heavy and light chains revealed common pathways of antibody-heavy chain maturation, confined to the IGHV1-2*02 lineage, involving dozens of somatic changes, and capable of pairing with different light chains. Broadly neutralizing HIV-1 immunity associated with VRC01-like antibodies thus involves the evolution of antibodies to a highly affinity-matured state required to recognize an invariant viral structure, with lineages defined from thousands of sequences providing genetic roadmaps of their development.},

abstract = {We describe methods to improve the properties of soluble, cleaved gp140 trimers of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins (Env) for use in structural studies and as immunogens. In the absence of nonionic detergents, gp140 of the KNH1144 genotype, terminating at residue 681 in gp41 (SOSIP.681), has a tendency to form higher-order complexes or aggregates, which is particularly undesirable for structure-based research. We found that this aggregation in the absence of detergent does not involve the V1, V2, or V3 variable regions of gp120. Moreover, we observed that detergent forms micelles around the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the SOSIP.681 gp140 trimers, whereas deletion of most of the MPER residues by terminating the gp140 at residue 664 (SOSIP.664) prevented the aggregation that otherwise occurs in SOSIP.681 in the absence of detergent. Although the MPER can contribute to trimer formation, truncation of most of it only modestly reduced trimerization and lacked global adverse effects on antigenicity. Thus, the MPER deletion minimally influenced the kinetics of the binding of soluble CD4 and a CD4-binding site antibody to immobilized trimers, as detected by surface plasmon resonance. Furthermore, the MPER deletion did not alter the overall three-dimensional structure of the trimers, as viewed by negative-stain electron microscopy. Homogeneous and aggregate-free MPER-truncated SOSIP Env trimers are therefore useful for immunogenicity and structural studies.},

abstract = {The envelope glycoprotein (Env) complex of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has evolved a structure that is minimally immunogenic while retaining its natural function of receptor-mediated virus-cell fusion. The Env complex is trimeric; its six individual subunits (three gp120 and three gp41 subunits) are associated by relatively weak, noncovalent interactions. The induction of neutralizing antibodies after vaccination with individual Env subunits has proven very difficult, probably because they are inadequate mimics of the native complex. Our hypothesis is that a stable form of the Env complex, perhaps with additional modifications to rationally alter its antigenic structure, may be a better immunogen than the individual subunits. A soluble form of Env, SOS gp140, can be made that has gp120 stably linked to the gp41 ectodomain by an intermolecular disulfide bond. This protein is fully cleaved at the proteolysis site between gp120 and gp41. However, the gp41-gp41 interactions in SOS gp140 are too weak to maintain the protein in a trimeric configuration. Consequently, purified SOS gp140 is a monomer (N. Sch{\"u}lke, M. S. Vesanen, R. W. Sanders, P. Zhu, D. J. Anselma, A. R. Villa, P. W. H. I. Parren, J. M. Binley, K. H. Roux, P. J. Maddon, J. P. Moore, and W. C. Olson, J. Virol. 76:7760-7776, 2002). Here we describe modifications of SOS gp140 that increase its trimer stability. A variant SOS gp140, designated SOSIP gp140, contains an isoleucine-to-proline substitution at position 559 in the N-terminal heptad repeat region of gp41. This protein is fully cleaved, has favorable antigenic properties, and is predominantly trimeric. SOSIP gp140 trimers are noncovalently associated and can be partially purified by gel filtration chromatography. These gp140 trimers are dissociated into monomers by anionic detergents or heat but are relatively resistant to nonionic detergents, high salt concentrations, or exposure to a mildly acidic pH. SOSIP gp140 should be a useful reagent for structural and immunogenicity studies.},

abstract = {We have identified a novel gene referred to as activation-induced deaminase (AID) by subtraction of cDNAs derived from switch-induced and uninduced murine B lymphoma CH12F3-2 cells, more than 80% of which switch exclusively to IgA upon stimulation. The amino acid sequence encoded by AID cDNA is homologous to that of apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC-1), a type of cytidine deaminase that constitutes a catalytic subunit for the apoB mRNA-editing complex. In vitro experiments using a glutathione S-transferase AID fusion protein revealed significant cytidine deaminase activity that is blocked by tetrahydrouridine and by zinc chelation. However, AID alone did neither demonstrate activity in C to U editing of apoB mRNA nor bind to AU-rich RNA targets. AID mRNA expression is induced in splenic B cells that were activated in vitro or by immunizations with sheep red blood cells. In situ hybridization of immunized spleen sections revealed the restricted expression of AID mRNA in developing germinal centers in which modulation of immunoglobulin gene information through somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination takes place. Taken together, these findings suggest that AID is a new member of the RNA-editing deaminase family and may play a role in genetic events in the germinal center B cell.},

abstract = {We have studied 18 participants in phase I/II clinical trials of recombinant gp120 (rgp120) subunit vaccines (MN and SF-2) who became infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) during the course of the trials. Of the 18 individuals, 2 had received a placebo vaccine, 9 had been immunized with MN rgp120, and seven had been immunized with SF-2 rgp120. Thirteen of the 18 infected vaccinees had received three or four immunizations prior to becoming infected. Of these, two were placebo recipients, six had received MN rgp120, and five had received SF-2 rgp120. Only 1 of the 11 rgp120 recipients who had multiple immunizations failed to develop a strong immunoglobulin G antibody response to the immunogen. However, the antibody response to rgp120 was transient, typically having a half-life of 40 to 60 days. No significant neutralizing activity against the infecting strain was detected in any of the infected individuals at any time prior to infection. Antibody titers in subjects infected despite vaccination and in noninfected subjects were not significantly different. Envelope-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses measured after infection were infrequent and weak in the nine vaccinees who were tested. HIV-1 was isolated successfully from all 18 individuals. Sixteen of these strains had a non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotype, while two had a syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype. NSI strains used the CCR5 coreceptor to enter CD4+ cells, while an SI strain from one of the vaccinees also used CXCR4. Viruses isolated from the blood of rgp120 vaccinees were indistinguishable from viruses isolated from control individuals in terms of their inherent sensitivity to neutralization by specific monoclonal antibodies and their replication rates in vitro. Furthermore, genetic sequencing of the env genes of strains infecting the vaccinees did not reveal any features that clearly distinguished these viruses from contemporary clade B viruses circulating in the United States. Thus, despite rigorous genetic analyses, using various breakdowns of the data sets, we could find no evidence that rgp120 vaccination exerted selection pressure on the infecting HIV-1 strains. The viral burdens in the infected rgp120 vaccine recipients were also determined, and they were found to be not significantly different from those in cohorts of placebo-vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals. In summary, we conclude that vaccination with rgp120 has had,to date, no obvious beneficial or adverse effects on the individuals we have studied.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:Standardized assessments of HIV-1 vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody responses are complicated by the genetic and antigenic variability of the viral envelope glycoproteins (Envs). To address these issues, suitable reference strains are needed that are representative of the global epidemic. Several panels have been recommended previously, but no clear answers have been available on how many and which strains are best suited for this purpose. We used a statistical model selection method to identify a global panel of reference Env clones from among 219 Env-pseudotyped viruses assayed in TZM-bl cells with sera from 205 HIV-1-infected individuals. The Envs and sera were sampled globally from diverse geographic locations and represented all major genetic subtypes and circulating recombinant forms of the virus. Assays with a panel size of only nine viruses adequately represented the spectrum of HIV-1 serum neutralizing activity seen with the larger panel of 219 viruses. An optimal panel of nine viruses was selected and augmented with three additional viruses for greater genetic and antigenic coverage. The spectrum of HIV-1 serum neutralizing activity seen with the final 12-virus panel closely approximated the activity seen with subtype-matched viruses. Moreover, the final panel was highly sensitive for detection of many of the known broadly neutralizing antibodies. For broader assay applications, all 12 Env clones were converted to infectious molecular clones using a proviral backbone carrying a Renilla luciferase reporter gene (Env.IMC.LucR viruses). This global panel should facilitate highly standardized assessments of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies across multiple HIV-1 vaccine platforms in different parts of the world.

IMPORTANCE:An effective HIV-1 vaccine will need to overcome the extraordinary genetic variability of the virus, where most variation occurs in the viral envelope glycoproteins that are the sole targets for neutralizing antibodies. Efforts to elicit broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies that will protect against infection by most circulating strains of the virus are guided in part by in vitro assays that determine the ability of vaccine-elicited antibodies to neutralize genetically diverse HIV-1 variants. Until now, little information was available on how many and which strains of the virus are best suited for this purpose. We applied robust statistical methods to evaluate a large neutralization data set and identified a small panel of viruses that are a good representation of the global epidemic. The neutralization properties of this new panel of reference strains should facilitate the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine.},

To identify and map conserved epitopes and regions in gp41 where structure is influenced by quaternary interactions, we used a panel of 38 conformation-dependent and 9 conformation-independent anti-gp41 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) produced by immunization of mice with oligomeric Env protein. By cross-competition experiments using these MAbs and several others previously described, six distinct antigenic determinants were identified and mapped. Three of these determinants are conformational in nature and dependent in part on Env oligomeric structure. MAbs to two of these determinants were broadly cross-reactive with Env proteins derived from primary virus strains. The prevalence of antibodies in HIV-1-positive human sera to the antigenic determinants was determined by the ability of such sera to block binding of MAbs to Env protein. Strong blocking activity that correlated with cross-reactivity was found.},

These native envelope glycoprotein complexes comprise three gp120 subunits noncovalently and weakly associated with three gp41 moieties. The individual subunits induce neutralizing antibodies inefficiently but raise many nonneutralizing antibodies. Consequently, recombinant envelope glycoproteins do not elicit strong antiviral antibody responses, particularly against primary HIV-1 isolates. To try to develop recombinant proteins that are better antigenic mimics of the native envelope glycoprotein complex, we have introduced a disulfide bond between the C-terminal region of gp120 and the immunodominant segment of the gp41 ectodomain. The resulting gp140 protein is processed efficiently, producing a properly folded envelope glycoprotein complex. The association of gp120 with gp41 is now stabilized by the supplementary intermolecular disulfide bond, which forms with approximately 50% efficiency. The gp140 protein has antigenic properties which resemble those of the virion-associated complex. This type of gp140 protein may be worth evaluating for immunogenicity as a component of a multivalent HIV-1 vaccine.},

abstract = {Induced overexpression of AID in CH12F3-2 B lymphoma cells augmented class switching from IgM to IgA without cytokine stimulation. AID deficiency caused a complete defect in class switching and showed a hyper-IgM phenotype with enlarged germinal centers containing strongly activated B cells before or after immunization. AID-/- spleen cells stimulated in vitro with LPS and cytokines failed to undergo class switch recombination although they expressed germline transcripts. Immunization of AID-/- chimera with 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP) chicken gamma-globulin induced neither accumulation of mutations in the NP-specific variable region gene nor class switching. These results suggest that AID may be involved in regulation or catalysis of the DNA modification step of both class switching and somatic hypermutation.},

abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

Here we show, for eight heterosexual transmission pairs, that recipient viruses were monophyletic, encoding compact, glycan-restricted envelope glycoproteins. These viruses were also uniquely sensitive to neutralization by antibody from the transmitting partner. Thus, the exposure of neutralizing epitopes, which are lost in chronic infection because of immune escape, appears to be favored in the newly infected host. This reveals characteristics of the envelope glycoprotein that influence HIV-1 transmission and may have implications for vaccine design.},

Information gained from high-throughput DNA sequencing of immunoglobulin genes (Ig-seq) can be applied to detect B-cell malignancies with high sensitivity, to discover antibodies specific for antigens of interest, to guide vaccine development and to understand autoimmunity. Rapid progress in the development of experimental protocols and informatics analysis tools is helping to reduce sequencing artifacts, to achieve more precise quantification of clonal diversity and to extract the most pertinent biological information. That said, broader application of Ig-seq, especially in clinical settings, will require the development of a standardized experimental design framework that will enable the sharing and meta-analysis of sequencing data generated by different laboratories.},

abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is a significant global public health problem for which development of an effective prophylactic vaccine remains a high scientific priority. Many concepts for a vaccine are focused on induction of appropriate titers of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the viral envelope (Env) glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, but no immunogen has yet accomplished this goal in animals or humans. One approach to induction of bNAbs is to design soluble, trimeric mimics of the native viral Env trimer. Here, we describe structural studies by negative-stain electron microscopy of several variants of soluble Env trimers based on the KNH1144 subtype A sequence. These Env trimers are fully cleaved between the gp120 and gp41 components and stabilized by specific amino acid substitutions. We also illustrate the structural consequences of deletion of the V1/V2 and V3 variable loops from gp120 and the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) from gp41. All of these variants adopt a trimeric configuration that appropriately mimics native Env spikes, including the CD4 receptor-binding site and the epitope for the VRC PG04 bNAb. These cleaved, soluble trimer designs can be adapted for use with multiple different env genes for both vaccine and structural studies.},

Mutations are likely generated by an error-prone DNA polymerase, and the mismatch repair pathway may process the mispairs. To examine the role of the MSH2 mismatch repair protein in hypermutation, Msh2-/- mice were immunized with oxazolone, and B cells were analyzed for mutation in their VkappaOx1 light chain genes. The frequency of mutation in the repair-deficient mice was similar to that in Msh2+/+ mice, showing that MSH2-dependent mismatch repair does not cause hypermutation. However, there was a striking bias for mutations to occur at germline G and C nucleotides. The results suggest that the hypermutation pathway frequently mutates G.C pairs, and a MSH2-dependent pathway preferentially corrects mismatches at G and C.},

DESIGN:A prospective, double-blind, randomized, immunogenicity and safety study was conducted in healthy adults at low risk for acquiring HIV infection and who were seronegative for HIV.

METHODS:CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells directed against Env or Gag expressing target cells were measured after live recombinant canarypox-HIV-1 vaccine priming (vaccine given at days 0, 7, 14 and 21). Neutralizing antibodies were measured after subunit boosting (vaccine given at days 28 and 84).

RESULTS:CD8+ CTL were induced in 64% of volunteers by the live recombinant canarypox-HIV-1 vaccine. All volunteers who received two doses of subunit vaccine after live recombinant canarypox priming developed neutralizing antibodies directed against laboratory strains of HIV-1 and seven out of eight volunteers tested developed neutralizing antibodies to the primary isolate, BZ167, but to none of eight other primary isolates. Unprimed controls had low or absent neutralizing antibodies after two doses of subunit vaccine.

CONCLUSIONS:The live canarypox vector was safe, stimulated cytotoxic T-cells and primed for a vigorous neutralizing antibody response upon boosting with subunit gp120 vaccine. This vaccine combination should be evaluated further for inducing protection against HIV infection.},

abstract = {Global human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) diversity may require engineering vaccines to express antigens representing strains prevalent in the target population of vaccine testing. The majority (90%) of incident infections in Thailand are genetic subtype E, with a small percentage of subtype B infections in the intravenous drug user populations. We have evaluated and compared the binding and HIV-1 neutralizing properties of serum antibodies induced in baboons by CHO cell-expressed monomeric gp120 derived from a CCR5-using (R5) subtype E primary HIV-1CM235 or a CXCR4-using (X4) subtype B T-cell line-adapted (TCLA) HIV-1SF2 isolate. In contrast to the subtype-specific HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies induced with recombinant HIV-1SF2 gp120 (rgp120SF2), rgp120CM235 immunization induced antibodies capable of neutralizing both subtype E and subtype B TCLA HIV-1 isolates. However, neither immunogen induced antibodies capable of neutralizing primary HIV-1 isolates. Antibody induced by rgp120CM235 preferentially bound natively folded gp120 and retained strong cross-reactivity against multiple gp120 strains within subtype E as well as subtype B. In contrast, antibody responses to rgp120SF2 were directed predominantly to linear epitopes poorly exposed on native gp120 and had more limited cross-recognition of divergent gp120. Fine epitope mapping revealed differences in antibody specificities. While both rgp120CM235 and rgp120SF2 induced antibodies to regions within C1, V1/V2, V3, and C5, unique responses were induced by rgp120CM235 to multiple epitopes within C2 and by rgp120SF2 to multiple epitopes within C3, V4, and C4. These data demonstrate that strain and/or phenotypic differences of HIV-1 subunit gp120 immunogens can substantially alter antibody binding specificities and subsequent HIV-1 neutralizing capacity.},

abstract = {As many key proteins evade crystallization and remain too large for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy combined with site-directed spin labeling offers an alternative approach for obtaining structural information. Such information must be translated into geometric restraints to be used in computer simulations. Here, distances between spin labels are converted into distance ranges between beta carbons by using a "motion-on-a-cone" model, and a linear-correlation model links spin-label accessibility to the number of neighboring residues. This approach was tested on T4-lysozyme and alphaA-crystallin with the de novo structure prediction algorithm Rosetta. The results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining highly accurate, atomic-detail models from EPR data by yielding 1.0 A and 2.6 A full-atom models, respectively. Distance restraints between amino acids far apart in sequence but close in space are most valuable for structure determination. The approach can be extended to other experimental techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, substituted cysteine accessibility method, or mutational studies.},

abstract = {Mature antibodies (Abs) that are exquisitely specific for virtually ally foreign molecule may be produced by affinity maturation of naive (or germline) Abs. However, the finite number of germline Abs available suggests that, in contrast to mature Abs, germline Ails must he broadly polyspecific so that they are able to recognize a wide range of ligands. Thus, affinity maturation must play a role in mediating Ab specificity. One biophysical property that distinguishes polyspecificity from specificity is protein flexibility: a flexible combining site is able to adopt different conformations that recognize different foreign molecules (or antigens). while a rigid combining site is locked into a conformation that is specific for a given antigen. Recent studies (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007, 104, 8821-8826000) have examined, at the atomic level, the structural properties that mediate changes in flexibility at lour stages of affinity maturation in the 4-4-20 Ab. These studies employed molecular dynamics simulations to reveal a network of residue interactions that mediate the flexibility changes accompanying maturation. The flexibility of the Ab combining sites in these molecular systems was originally measured using three-pulse photon echo spectroscopy (3PEPS). The present investigation extends this work by providing a concrete link between structural properties of the Ab molecules and features of the spectroscopic measurements used to characterize their flexibility. Results obtained from the simulations are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental measurements and indicate that the spectroscopic signal is sensitive to protein dynamics distributed throughout the entire combining site. Thus, the simulations provide a molecular-level interpretation of the changes induced by affinity maturation of the Ab. The results suggest that 3PEPS spectroscopy in combination with molecular dynamics simulations can provide a detailed description of protein dynamics and, in this case, how it is evolved for biological function.},

All VH and VL families were identified. Four different VH families were represented, VH3 being the most common as five of the mAbs (BY-7, BY-12, IRM-3, IRM-8 and CDC-1) used genetic elements of this family, whereas VH1, VH2 and VH4 were only present in IRM-7, BY-4 and IRM-10, respectively. BY-4, BY-7, BY-12, IRM-7 and IRM-10 reacted with a variety of self as well as non-self antigens, thus exhibiting polyreactive behaviour. Comparison of the gene segments utilized by these mAbs with their germline counterparts revealed that the gene segments were close to germline configuration. The length of H-CDR3 was found to be relatively long (27-60 nucleotides) among the polyreactive mAbs and the presence of Tyr and Trp residues in this region seems to be of vital importance for polyreactivity. We have analysed the utilization of gene elements and the presence of amino acid residues in regions particularly important for antigen binding, such as CDR. Common molecular features relating to the function of the mAbs are discussed.},

The corresponding genes may be duplicated and then mutated to select and optimize a specific conformation. However, testing this idea has been difficult because of the challenge of quantifying protein flexibility and conformational heterogeneity as a function of evolution. Here, we report the characterization of protein heterogeneity and dynamics as a function of evolution for the antifluorescein antibody 4-4-20. Using nonlinear laser spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance, and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that evolution localized the Ab-combining site from a heterogeneous ensemble of conformations to a single conformation by introducing mutations that act cooperatively and over significant distances to rigidify the protein. This study demonstrates how protein dynamics may be tailored by evolution and has important implications for our understanding of how novel protein functions are evolved.},

This variability not only makes it difficult to identify the targets against which immune responses should be directed, but it also confers on the virus the capacity for rapid escape from effective immune responses. Here, we describe recent investigations of the genetic diversity of HIV-1 at transmission and of the evolution of the virus as it adapts to the host immune environment during the acute phase of HIV-1 infection. These studies increase our understanding of the virology of the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection and provide critical insights into the mechanisms underlying viral replication and immune control of diverse HIV-1 strains. Such knowledge will inform the design of smarter, more effective vaccines capable of inducing immune control of HIV-1.},

abstract = {Polyreactive antibodies (Abs) constitute a major proportion of the early Ab repertoire and are an important component of the natural defense mechanisms against infections. They are primarily immunoglobulin M (IgM) and bind a variety of structurally dissimilar self and exogenous antigens (Ags) with moderate affinity. We analyzed the contribution of Ig polyvalency and of heavy (H) and light (L) chain variable (V) regions to polyreactivity in recombinatorial experiments involving the VH-diversity(D)-JH and V kappa-J kappa gene segments of a human polyreactive IgM, monoclonal antibody 55 (mAb55), and those of a human monoreactive anti-insulin IgG, mAb13, in an in vitro C gamma l and C kappa human expression system. These mAbs are virtually identical in their VH and V kappa gene segment sequences. First, we expressed the VH-D-JH and V kappa-J kappa genes of the IgM mAb55 as V segments of an IgG molecule. The bivalent recombinant IgG Ab bound multiple Ags with an efficiency only slightly lower than that of the original decavalent IgM mAb55, suggesting that class switch to IgG does not affect the Ig polyreactivity. Second, we coexpressed the mAb55-derived H or kappa chain with the mAb13-derived kappa or H chain, respectively. The hybrid IgG Ab bearing the mAb55-derived H chain V segment paired with the mAb13-derived kappa V segment, but not that bearing the mAb13-derived H chain V segment paired with the mAb55-derived kappa V segment, bound multiple Ags, suggesting that the Ig H chain plays a major role in the Ig polyreactivity. Third, we shuffled the framework 1 (FR1)-FR3 and complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) regions of the H and kappa chain V segments of the mAB55-derived IgG molecule with the corresponding regions of the monoreactive IgG mAb13. The mAb55-derived IgG molecule lost polyreactivity when the H chain CDR3, but not the FR1-FR3 region, was replaced by the corresponding region of mAb13, suggesting that within the H chain, the CDR3 provides the major structural correlate for multiple Ag-binding. This was formally proved by the multiple Ag-binding of the originally monoreactive mAb13-derived IgG molecule grafted with the mAb55-derived H chain CDR3. The polyreactivity of this chimeric IgG was maximized by grafting of the mAb55-derived kappa chain FR1-FR3, but not that of the kappa chain CDR3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Likely creation of mismatches during somatic hypermutation has stimulated interest in the effect of mismatch repair deficiency on the process. Analysis of unselected mutations in the 3' flank of VH rearrangements in germinal center B cells revealed that MSH2 deficiency caused a 5-fold reduced mutation accumulation. This might reflect ectopic effects of the Msh2 disruption; indeed, the mice exhibit other perturbations within the B cell compartment. However, that MSH2 (or factors dependent upon it) plays a role in the mechanism of mutation fixation is indicated by a strikingly increased focusing of the mutations on intrinsic hot spots. We propose two phases to hypermutation targeting. The first is hot spot focused and MSH2 independent; the second, MSH2-dependent phase yields a more even spread of mutation fixation.},

abstract = {We have analysed the atomic structures of Fab and VL fragments of immunoglobulins to determine the relationship between their amino acid sequences and the three-dimensional structures of their antigen binding sites. We identify the relatively few residues that, through their packing, hydrogen bonding or the ability to assume unusual phi, psi or omega conformations, are primarily responsible for the main-chain conformations of the hypervariable regions. These residues are found to occur at sites within the hypervariable regions and in the conserved beta-sheet framework. Examination of the sequences of immunoglobulins of unknown structure shows that many have hypervariable regions that are similar in size to one of the known structures and contain identical residues at the sites responsible for the observed conformation. This implies that these hypervariable regions have conformations close to those in the known structures. For five of the hypervariable regions, the repertoire of conformations appears to be limited to a relatively small number of discrete structural classes. We call the commonly occurring main-chain conformations of the hypervariable regions "canonical structures". The accuracy of the analysis is being tested and refined by the prediction of immunoglobulin structures prior to their experimental determination.},

We studied the immune response in mice deficient in MutS homologue (MSH)3 and MSH6, two mutually exclusive partners of MSH2 that have not been examined previously for their role in Ig hypermutation. In Msh6(-)/- and Msh3(-)/-/Msh6(-)/- mice, base substitutions are preferentially targeted to G and C nucleotides and to an RGYW hot spot, as has been shown previously in Msh2(-)/- mice. In contrast, Msh3(-)/- mice show no differences from their littermate controls. These findings indicate that the MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer, but not the MSH2-MSH3 complex, is responsible for modulating Ig hypermutation.},

Immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes are diversified after gene rearrangement by hypermutation. In the DNA deamination model, we have proposed that deamination of dC residues to dU by activation-induced deaminase (AID) triggers this diversification. In hypermutating chicken DT40 B cells, most IgV mutations are dC --> dG/dA or dG --> dC/dT transversions, which are proposed to result from replication over sites of base loss produced by the excision activity of uracil-DNA glycosylase. Blocking the activity of uracil-DNA glycosylase should instead lead to replication over the dU lesion, resulting in dC --> dT (and dG --> dA) transitions. Here we show that expression in DT40 cells of a bacteriophage-encoded protein that inhibits uracil-DNA glycosylase shifts the pattern of IgV gene mutations from transversion dominance to transition dominance. This is good evidence that antibody diversification involves dC --> dU deamination within the immunoglobulin locus itself.},

abstract = {Most neutralizing antibodies act at the earliest steps of viral infection and block interaction of the virus with cellular receptors to prevent entry into host cells. The inability to induce neutralizing antibodies to HIV has been a major obstacle to HIV vaccine research since the early days of the epidemic. However, in the past three years, the definition of a neutralizing antibody against HIV has been revolutionized by the isolation of extremely broad and potent neutralizing antibodies from HIV-infected individuals. Considerable hurdles remain for inducing neutralizing antibodies to a protective level after immunization. Meanwhile, novel technologies to bypass the induction of antibodies are being explored to provide prophylactic antibody-based interventions. This review addresses the challenge of inducing HIV neutralizing antibodies upon immunization and considers notable recent advances in the field. A greater understanding of the successes and failures for inducing a neutralizing response upon immunization is required to accelerate the development of an effective HIV vaccine.},

Although these events were previously reported, they had never been formally associated with the somatic hypermutation process. I/D events share with more conventional somatic hypermutation events their localization within hypervariable regions and, most particularly, within DNA motifs known to be mutational hot spots. Repetitive DNA tracts or DNA elements capable of forming DNA loop intermediates seem to be the preferred substrate for I/D to occur. These characteristics suggest a model for somatic hypermutation reminiscent of the "polymerase slippage" model involved in replication and repair mutations in prokaryotes, yeast, and mammals.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:It has been suggested that codon insertion and/or deletion may represent a mechanism that, along with hypermutation, contributes to the affinity maturation of antibodies. We used repertoire cloning to examine human antibodies directed against 3 carbohydrate antigens and 1 protein antigen for the presence of such modifications. We find that both the insertion and deletion of codons occur frequently in antigen-specific responses following vaccination. Codon insertions and deletions were observed most often in the complementarity determining regions, and less frequently in the framework regions, of VH, Vkappa, and Vlambda gene segments, and involved motifs known to be preferred targets of somatic hypermutation. Clonal lineage analysis shows that these events occur through out the course of the somatic maturation of individual antibody clones. We also determined that these alterations of paratope structure have varying effects on the relative affinity of the binding site for its cognate antigen.

abstract = {During a germinal center reaction, random mutations are introduced into immunoglobulin V genes to increase the affinity of antibody molecules and to further diversify the B cell repertoire. Antigen-directed selection of B cell clones that generate high affinity surface Ig results in the affinity maturation of the antibody response. The mutations of Ig genes are typically basepair substitutions, although DNA insertions and deletions have been reported to occur at a low frequency. In this study, we describe five insertion and four deletion events in otherwise somatically mutated VH gene cDNA molecules. Two of these insertions and all four deletions were obtained through the sequencing of 395 cDNA clones (approximately 110,000 nucleotides) from CD38+IgD- germinal center, and CD38-IgD- memory B cell populations from a single human tonsil. No germline genes that could have encoded these six cDNA clones were found after an extensive characterization of the genomic VH4 repertoire of the tonsil donor. These six insertions or deletions and three additional insertion events isolated from other sources occurred as triplets or multiples thereof, leaving the transcripts in frame. Additionally, 8 of 9 of these events occurred in the CDR1 or CDR2, following a pattern consistent with selection, and making it unlikely that these events were artifacts of the experimental system. The lack of similar instances in unmutated IgD+CD38- follicular mantle cDNA clones statistically associates these events to the somatic hypermutation process (P = 0.014). Close scrutiny of the 9 insertion/deletion events reported here, and of 25 additional insertions or deletions collected from the literature, suggest that secondary structural elements in the DNA sequences capable of producing loop intermediates may be a prerequisite in most instances. Furthermore, these events most frequently involve sequence motifs resembling known intrinsic hotspots of somatic hypermutation. These insertion/deletion events are consistent with models of somatic hypermutation involving an unstable polymerase enzyme complex lacking proofreading capabilities, and suggest a downregulation or alteration of DNA repair at the V locus during the hypermutation process.},

abstract = {Influenza viruses take a yearly toll on human life despite efforts to contain them with seasonal vaccines. These viruses evade human immunity through the evolution of variants that resist neutralization. The identification of antibodies that recognize invariant structures on the influenza haemagglutinin (HA) protein have invigorated efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines. Specifically, antibodies to the highly conserved stem region of HA neutralize diverse viral subtypes. These antibodies largely derive from a specific antibody gene, heavy-chain variable region IGHV1-69, after limited affinity maturation from their germline ancestors, but how HA stimulates naive B cells to mature and induce protective immunity is unknown. To address this question, we analysed the structural and genetic basis for their engagement and maturation into broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here we show that the germline-encoded precursors of these antibodies act as functional B-cell antigen receptors (BCRs) that initiate subsequent affinity maturation. Neither the germline precursor of a prototypic antibody, CR6261 (ref. 3), nor those of two other natural human IGHV1-69 antibodies, bound HA as soluble immunoglobulin-G (IgG). However, all three IGHV1-69 precursors engaged HA when the antibody was expressed as cell surface IgM. HA triggered BCR-associated tyrosine kinase signalling by germline transmembrane IgM. Recognition and virus neutralization was dependent solely on the heavy chain, and affinity maturation of CR6261 required only seven amino acids in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) H1 and framework region 3 (FR3) to restore full activity. These findings provide insight into the initial events that lead to the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza, informing the rational design of vaccines to elicit such antibodies and providing a model relevant to other infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS. The data further suggest that selected immunoglobulin genes recognize specific protein structural 'patterns' that provide a substrate for further affinity maturation.},

abstract = {The variable domain of an immunoglobulin (IG) sequence is encoded by multiple genes, including the variable (V) gene, the diversity (D) gene and the joining (J) gene. Analysis of IG sequences typically requires identification of each gene, as well as a comparison of sequence variations in the context of defined regions. General purpose tools, such as the BLAST program, have only limited use for such tasks, as the rearranged nature of an IG sequence and the variable length of each gene requires multiple rounds of BLAST searches for a single IG sequence. Additionally, manual assembly of different genes is difficult and error-prone. To address these issues and to facilitate other common tasks in analysing IG sequences, we have developed the sequence analysis tool IgBLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/). With this tool, users can view the matches to the germline V, D and J genes, details at rearrangement junctions, the delineation of IG V domain framework regions and complementarity determining regions. IgBLAST has the capability to analyse nucleotide and protein sequences and can process sequences in batches. Furthermore, IgBLAST allows searches against the germline gene databases and other sequence databases simultaneously to minimize the chance of missing possibly the best matching germline V gene.},

abstract = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of gp120 are generated by some HIV-1-infected individuals, but little is known about the prevalence and evolution of this antibody response during the course of HIV-1 infection. We analyzed the sera of 113 HIV-1 seroconverters from three cohorts for binding to a panel of gp120 core proteins and their corresponding CD4bs knockout mutants. Among sera collected between 99 and 258 weeks post-HIV-1 infection, 88% contained antibodies to the CD4bs and 47% contained antibodies to resurfaced stabilized core (RSC) probes that react preferentially with broadly neutralizing CD4bs antibodies (BNCD4), such as monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) VRC01 and VRC-CH31. Analysis of longitudinal serum samples from a subset of 18 subjects revealed that CD4bs antibodies to gp120 arose within the first 4 to 16 weeks of infection, while the development of RSC-reactive antibodies was more varied, occurring between 10 and 152 weeks post-HIV-1 infection. Despite the presence of these antibodies, serum neutralization mediated by RSC-reactive antibodies was detected in sera from only a few donors infected for more than 3 years. Thus, CD4bs antibodies that bind a VRC01-like epitope are often induced during HIV-1 infection, but the level and potency required to mediate serum neutralization may take years to develop. An improved understanding of the immunological factors associated with the development and maturation of neutralizing CD4bs antibodies during HIV-1 infection may provide insights into the requirements for eliciting this response by vaccination.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) binding to bacterial flagellin activates signaling through the transcription factor NF-$\kappa$B and triggers an innate immune response to the invading pathogen. To elucidate the structural basis and mechanistic implications of TLR5-flagellin recognition, we determined the crystal structure of zebrafish TLR5 (as a variable lymphocyte receptor hybrid protein) in complex with the D1/D2/D3 fragment of Salmonella flagellin, FliC, at 2.47 angstrom resolution. TLR5 interacts primarily with the three helices of the FliC D1 domain using its lateral side. Two TLR5-FliC 1:1 heterodimers assemble into a 2:2 tail-to-tail signaling complex that is stabilized by quaternary contacts of the FliC D1 domain with the convex surface of the opposing TLR5. The proposed signaling mechanism is supported by structure-guided mutagenesis and deletion analyses on CBLB502, a therapeutic protein derived from FliC.},
