\cventry{2009-2014}{Graduate Research Assistant}{Vanderbilt University Medical Center}{Nashville}{TN}{Computational design to answer specific questions about HIV immunology. The computational work was accomplished in the Meiler laboratory while the experimental laboratory work was conducted in the Crowe laboratory. My thesis work can be divided into four parts:%
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1mm,topsep=1mm,leftmargin=.25in,parsep=1mm]
\item Multi-state antibody design to interrogate mechanisms for antibody polyspecificity. 
\item Molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 CD4-binding site escape.
\item Determine how closely antibody repertoires from HIV-na\"{i}ve individuals are to known broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV. 
\item Computational design of antibodies with increased neutralization breadth against diverse natural variants of the influenza hemagglutinin stem.
\end{enumerate}}
