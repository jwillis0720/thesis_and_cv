\caption[HiSeq 64-Donor Statistics]{Sequencing results from the HiSeq of 64 donors. Raw reads indicate the amount of reads that passed VANTAGE quality metrics. Joined reads are reads that found a paired end partner and could be joined together. Unique reads removed duplicates. Productive HCDR3s are those reads that do not contain a stop codon. Unique CDR3s are those HCDR3s that are not duplicated by amino acid sequence. 30 length HCDR3s are those sequences that are 30 amino acids long by IMGT numbering. Unique HCDR3 sequences are those sequences that are not duplicated in any donor by amino acids.}
